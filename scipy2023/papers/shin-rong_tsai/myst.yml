  title: 'libyt: a Tool for Parallel In Situ Analysis with yt'
  description: In the era of exascale computing, storage and analysis of large scale data have become  more important and difficult.  We present libyt, an open source C++ library, that allows researchers to analyze and  visualize data using yt or other Python packages in parallel during simulation runtime.
