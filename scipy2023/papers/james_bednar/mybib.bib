                  learn how to build and maintain reliable, scalable,
                  distributed systems with Apache Hadoop. This book is
                  ideal for programmers looking to analyze datasets of
                  any size, and for administrators who want to set up
                  and run Hadoop clusters. Using Hadoop 2 exclusively,
                  author Tom White presents new chapters on YARN and
                  several Hadoop-related projects such as Parquet,
                  Flume, Crunch, and Spark. You'll learn about recent
                  changes to Hadoop, and explore new case studies on
                  Hadoop's role in healthcare systems and genomics
