title: "Spatio-temporal analysis of socioeconomic neighborhoods: The Open Source
  Longitudinal Neighborhood Analysis Package (OSLNAP)"
description: The neighborhood effects literature represents a wide span of the
  social sciences broadly concerned with the influence of spatial context on
  social processes. From the study of segregation dynamics, the relationships
  between the built environment and health outcomes, to the impact of
  concentrated poverty on social efficacy, neighborhoods are a central construct
  in empirical work.
abstract: "The neighborhood effects literature represents a wide span of the
  social sciences broadly concerned with the influence of spatial context on
  social processes. From the study of segregation dynamics, the relationships
  between the built environment and health outcomes, to the impact of
  concentrated poverty on social efficacy, neighborhoods are a central construct
  in empirical work. From a dynamic lens, neighborhoods experience changes not
  only in their socioeconomic composition, but also in spatial extent; however,
  the literature has ignored the latter source of change. In this paper, we
  discuss the development of a novel, spatially explicit tool: the Open Source
  Longitudinal Neighborhood Analysis Package (OSLNAP) using the scientific
  Python ecosystem."
