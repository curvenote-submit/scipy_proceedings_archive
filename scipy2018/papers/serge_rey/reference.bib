	Abstract = {Discrete Markov chain models (DMCs) have been widely applied to the study of regional income distribution dynamics and convergence. This popularity reflects the rich body of DMC theory on the one hand and the ability of this framework to provide insights on the internal and external properties of regional income distribution dynamics on the other. In this paper we examine the properties of tests for spatial effects in DMC models of regional distribution dynamics. We do so through a series of Monte Carlo simulations designed to examine the size, power and robustness of tests for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence in transitional dynamics. This requires that we specify a data generating process for not only the null, but also alternatives when spatial heterogeneity or spatial dependence is present in the transitional dynamics. We are not aware of any work which has examined these types of data generating processes in the spatial distribution dynamics literature. Results indicate that tests for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence display good power for the presence of spatial effects. However, tests for spatial heterogeneity are not robust to the presence of strong spatial dependence, while tests for spatial dependence are sensitive to the spatial configuration of heterogeneity. When the spatial configuration can be considered random, dependence tests are robust to the dynamic spatial heterogeneity, but not so to the process mean heterogeneity when the difference in process means is large relative to the variance of the time series.},

@article{ababa2016,
	Abstract = {AbstractDefining homogeneous precipitation regions is
		  fundamental for hydrologic applications, yet nontrivial,
		  particularly for regions with highly varied
		  spatial--temporal patterns. Traditional approaches
		  typically include aspects of subjective delineation around
		  sparsely distributed precipitation stations. Here,
		  hierarchical and nonhierarchical (k means) clustering
		  techniques on a gridded dataset for objective and automatic
		  delineation are evaluated. Using a spatial sensitivity
		  analysis test, the k-means clustering method is found to
		  produce much more stable cluster boundaries. To identify a
		  reasonable optimal k, various performance indicators,
		  including the within-cluster sum of square errors (WSS)
		  metric, intra- and intercluster correlations, and
		  postvisualization are evaluated. Two new objective
		  selection metrics (difference in minimum WSS and difference
		  in difference) are developed based on the elbow method and
		  gap statistics, respectively, to determine k within a
		  desired range. Consequently, eight homogenous regions are
		  defined with relatively clear and smooth boundaries, as
		  well as low intercluster correlations and high intracluster
		  correlations. The underlying physical mechanisms for the
		  regionalization outcomes not only help justify the optimal
		  number of clusters selected, but also prove informative in
		  understanding the local- and large-scale climate factors
		  affecting Ethiopian summertime precipitation. A principal
		  component linear regression model to produce cluster-level
		  seasonal forecasts also proves skillful.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, social marketing principles and
		  techniques have featured at the heart of government
		  proposals for improving health and tackling health
		  inequalities. This, in part, has led to a shift in the type
		  of information and intelligence needed to support service

		  increasing interest in the use of commercial geodemographic
		  classification systems. Despite the amount of activity and

		  National Health Service. This paper describes some of the
		  potential applications of geodemographic tools in the

	Abstract = {This study asks whether regional economic and racial
		  segregation have negative effects not only on people with
		  lower incomes or racial and ethnic minorities, but on all
		  residents and the region as a whole. We analyze the 100
		  most-populous commuting zones (CZs, which correspond
		  generally with metropolitan areas) from 1990 to 2010 and
		  consider five CZ-level outcomes: median household income,
		  per capita income, proportion of residents ages 25 and
		  older with bachelor's degrees, life expectancy, and
		  homicide rate. If higher levels of segregation are
		  associated with worse CZ outcomes, efforts to reduce
		  economic and residential segregation could benefit all
		  residents across metropolitan areas. We find that higher
		  levels of economic segregation are associated with lower
		  incomes, particularly for black residents. Further, higher
		  levels of racial segregation are associated with lower
		  incomes for blacks, lower educational attainment for whites
		  and blacks, and lower levels of safety for all area
		  residents.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nWe use our research on
		  the 100 most-populous CZs to assess how racial and economic
		  segregation contribute to quality-of-life outcomes in the
		  Chicago metropolitan area. Challenges in Chicago---from
		  depopulation to rising homicides---indicate a need to focus
		  on segregation's effects on the region's prosperity. The
		  Chicago case also illustrates the cost of segregation and
		  provides a model for conducting similar cost estimates in
		  other regions. Our research on 100 CZs and the Chicago
		  metro area produced three major
		  findings:$\backslash$r$\backslash$n The nation is
		  changing in its spatial patterns, but remains starkly
		  segregated by race and income.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n
		  There is a real cost to segregation, which varies by race
		  and ethnicity.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n Chicago
		  continues to struggle as a highly segregated metro area,
		  which has major effects for all residents.},

	Abstract = {This article investigates the shifting racial and ethnic
		  composition of neighborhoods in the Greater New York
		  metropolitan region in the 1970-1990 period, during; which
		  the region has been one of the nation's major receiving
		  grounds for new immigrant groups. Neighborhoods are defined
		  in terms of census tracts, and changes in neighborhood
		  composi? tion are tracked with data from the 1970, 1980,
		  and 1990 censuses. Four racial/ethnic groups are
		  considered: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
		  Hispanics and Asians. The analysis, which exploits the
		  neighbor? hood transition table (Denton and Massey, 1991),
		  reveals a somewhat paradoxical set of developments. On the
		  one hand, there is increasing racial and ethnic complexity
		  in neighborhoods throughout the region: more and more
		  neighborhoods contain multiple groups; fewer and fewer are
		  ethnically or racially homogeneous. On the other hand,
		  there is a crosscutting trend: all-minority neighborhoods,
		  occupied by blacks or blacks and Hispanics, are growing in
		  number. We demonstrate further that these two patterns are
		  associated with other characteristics of neigh? borhoods,
		  such as the median incomes of their households and whether
		  they are located in cities or suburbs.},

		  presents an efficient method for regionalization. The first
		  step creates a connectivity graph that captures the
		  neighbourhood relationship between the spatial objects. The
		  cost of each edge in the graph is inversely proportional to
		  the similarity between the regions it joins. We summarize
		  the neighbourhood structure by a minimum spanning tree
		  (MST), which is a connected tree with no circuits. We
		  partition the MST by successive removal of edges that link
		  dissimilar regions. The result is the division of the
		  spatial objects into connected regions that have maximum
		  internal homogeneity. Since the MST partitioning problem is
		  NP-hard, we propose a heuristic to speed up the tree
		  partitioning significantly. Our results show that our

	Abstract = {Clustering geographically referenced data is an important
		  issue in Geographic Information Science. Although the
		  standard SOM can be used in many of these problems, it is
		  useful to have a clustering tool that takes into account
		  the special importance that geographic location has in
		  these problems. In this paper, such a tool, named GEO-SOM,
		  is presented. The differences between the training and
		  mapping algorithms of the standard SOM and GEO-SOM are
		  pointed out, and some simple examples of applications are
		  given. Another important issue in the analysis of
		  geo-referenced data is visualization of results, and
		  integration with well established Geographic Information
		  Systems (GIS). It is shown that GEO-SOM can easily be
		  integrated in such systems, and examples of relevant
		  visualization tools are presented. The fundamental
		  assumption of the GEO-SOM is that some variables (in this

	Abstract = {Optimalmatching (OM)is a method that assesses sequence
		  sim- ilarity. It was originally developed to study protein
		  and DNA sequences and was later transferred to the social
		  sciences where it was applied accordingly. However, there
		  is an ongoing debate on the adequacy of its use in the
		  social sciences, as a superficial transfer might not
		  respond to the significant differences between typical
		  sequences in biological and social settings. In this pa-
		  per, I elaborate on these differences and introduce a
		  distinction between two sequence types---namely, common
		  ancestors and unfolding processes. While the first sequence
		  type is typically found in biological settings (e.g., DNA
		  sequences), the latter applies to most sequences studied in
		  the social sciences (e.g., careers). Based on this
		  distinction, I present a new way of cod- ing sequences as
		  an extension to conventionalOManalyses and demonstrate its
		  usefulness in simulated and empirical examples. The paper
		  concludeswith a discussion of this newapproach and its
		  integration into previous extensions of OM.},

	Abstract = {In this article we discuss optimal matching (OM), an
		  invaluable yet underutilized tool in the analysis of
		  sequence data. Initially developed in biology to identify
		  and study patterns in DNA sequences, OM subsequently
		  migrated over to sociology, where it has been used to
		  examine career patterns in life course research. It
		  involves the computation of the number of insertions,
		  deletions, and substitutions of sequence elements that are
		  needed to transform one sequence into another and the costs
		  associated with such transformations. The goal is to
		  identify similarities across sequences, which can then be
		  used for pattern identification. Along with a discussion of
		  the logic underlying OM analysis, we provide an
		  illustration of its use in the examination of careers of
		  deans at U.S. business schools. In addition, we use Monte
		  Carlo simulation to compare OM and cluster analysis and
		  highlight the superiority of OM analysis in the analysis of
		  sequence data. Also discussed are recent methodological
		  advances that have been made in OM and our recommendations
		  and guidelines for future applications of OM in management
		  research.},

@article{birkin2012,
	Abstract = {The generation of synthetic population estimates through
		  spatial microsimulation has been a popular technique in
		  recent years, with applications to research and policy
		  problems in many areas of social science. Estimation
		  techniques typically involve cloning or matching households
		  in surveys with small-area census data. When model
		  estimates are benchmarked against real-world data, the
		  models are typically well behaved and very robust, but they
		  can struggle to capture the diversity of spatial variations
		  shown by observed data. We argue in this paper that this is
		  the result of 3 potential problems in spatial
		  microsimulation estimation techniques. The first issue
		  results from the matching process in the estimation
		  techniques, and the second problem relates to the
		  variations of household types in the surveys being
		  reweighted. Third, similar household types may show
		  different behaviours or have different attributes depending
		  on geographical factors not contained in surveys (such as
		  the proximity of service or job locations). The aim of this
		  paper is to demonstrate and measure the loss of accuracy
		  and intensity induced by spatial microsimulation in the
		  context of real individual data. It will be argued in
		  particular that while the first two problems have begun to
		  be addressed in the literature, the third issue is still
		  largely unreported. The paper will thus suggest a solution
		  framework which involves linking spatial microsimulation
		  models with geodemographics and demonstrates the promise of
		  this technique with real numerical experiments.

	Abstract = {This paper identifies a new factor, the age of the housing
		  stock, that affects where high- and low-income
		  neighborhoods are located in U.S. cities. High-income
		  households, driven by a high demand for housing services,
		  tend to locate in areas of the city where the housing stock
		  is relatively young. Because cities develop and redevelop
		  from the center outward over time, the location of these
		  neighborhoods varies over the city's history. The model
		  predicts a suburban location for the rich in an initial
		  period, when young dwellings are found only in the suburbs,
		  while predicting eventual gentrification once central
		  redevelopment creates a young downtown housing stock.
		  Controlling for other determinants of where the poor live
		  (e.g., proximity to amenities and public transit),
		  empirical work indicates that if the influence of spatial
		  variation in dwelling ages were eliminated,
		  central-city/suburban disparities in neighborhood economic
		  status would be reduced by up to 10 percentage points.
		  Model estimates further predict that between 2000 and 2020,
		  central-city/suburban differences in economic status will
		  narrow in cities of all sizes, and especially in the larger
		  metropolitan areas as American cities become more

	Abstract = {The aggregation of urban population has been described by
		  B{\"{u}}cher and Weber. A sociological study of the growth
		  of the city, however, is concerned with the definition and
		  description of processes, as those of (a) expansion, (b)
		  metabolism, and (c) mobility. The typical tendency of urban
		  growth is the expansion radially from its central business
		  district by a series of concentric circles, as (a) the
		  central business district, (b) a zone of deterioration, (c)
		  a zone of workingmen's homes, (d) a residential area, and
		  (e) a commuters' zone. Urban growth may be even more
		  fundamentally stated as the resultant of processes of
		  organization and disorganization, like the anabolic and
		  katabolic processes of metabolism in the human body. The
		  distribution of population into the natural areas of the
		  city, the division of labor, the differentiation into
		  social and cultural groupings, represent the normal
		  manifestations of urban metabolism, as statistics of
		  disease, crime, disorder, vice, insanity, and suicide are
		  rough indexes of its abnormal expression. The state of
		  metabolism of the city may, it is suggested, be measured by
		  mobility, defined as a change of movement in response to a
		  new stimulus or situation. Areas in the city of the
		  greatest mobility are found to be also regions of juvenile
		  delinquency, boys' gangs, crime, poverty, wife desertion,
		  divorce, abandoned infants, etc. Suggested indexes of
		  mobility are statistics of changes of movement and increase
		  of contacts of city population, as in the increase per
		  capita in the total annual rides on surface and elevated
		  lines, number of automobiles, letters received, telephones,
		  and land values. A cross-section of the city has been
		  selected for the intensive study of urban growth in terms
		  of expansion, metabolism, and mobility.},

@article{carvalho2016,
	Abstract = {In order to study climate change on a regional scale using
		  Earth System Models, it is useful to partition the spatial
		  domain into regions according to their climate changes. The
		  aim of this work is to divide the European domain into
		  regions of similar projected climate changes using a
		  simulation of daily total precipitation, minimum and
		  maximum temperatures for the recent-past (1986--2005) and
		  long-term future (2081--2100) provided by the Coupled
		  Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The difference
		  between the long-term future and recent-past daily
		  climatologies of these three variables is determined.
		  Aiming to objectively identify the grid points with
		  coherent climate changes, a K-Mean Cluster Analysis is
		  applied to these differences. This method is performed for
		  each variable independently (univariate version) and for
		  the aggregation of the three variables (multivariate
		  version). A mathematical approach to determine the optimal
		  number of clusters is pursued. However, due to the method
		  characteristics, a sensitivity test to the number of
		  clusters is performed by analysing the consistency of the
		  results. This is a novel method, allowing for the
		  determination of regions based on the climate change of
		  multiple variables. Results from the univariate application
		  of this method are in accordance with results found in the
		  literature, showing overall similar regions of changes. The
		  regions obtained for the multivariate version are mainly
		  defined by latitude over European land, with some features
		  of land-sea interaction. Furthermore, all regions have
		  statistically different distributions of at least one of
		  the variables, providing confidence to the regions
		  obtained.},

		  By applying OMA to career history data, this article shows

		  Like all techniques that involve pairwise comparison

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a Ward-like hierarchical
		  clustering algorithm including spatial/geographical
		  constraints. Two dissimilarity matrices {\$}D{\_}0{\$} and

		  {\$}\backslashalpha \backslashin [0,1]{\$}. The

		  The criterion minimized at each stage is a convex
		  combination of the homogeneity criterion calculated with
		  {\$}D{\_}0{\$} and the homogeneity criterion calculated
		  with {\$}D{\_}1{\$}. The idea is then to determine a value

	Abstract = {We use administrative records on the incomes of more than
		  40 million children and their parents to describe three
		  features of intergenerational mo- bility in the United
		  States. First, we characterize the joint distribution of
		  parent and child income at the national level. The
		  conditional expectation of child income given parent income
		  is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile
		  increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4
		  percentile increasein a child's income. Second,
		  intergenerational mobility varies substantially across
		  areas within the United States. For example, the
		  probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the
		  national income distribution starting from a family in the
		  bottom quintile is 4.4{\%} in Charlotte but 12.9{\%} in San
		  Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward
		  mobility. High mo- bility areas have (i) less residential
		  segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better
		  primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v)
		  greater family stabil- ity. Although our descriptive
		  analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that
		  determine upward mobility, the publicly available
		  statistics on interge- nerational mobility developed here
		  can facilitate research on such mechanisms. JEL},

		  randomly selected families living in high- poverty housing
		  projects housing vouchers to move to lower-poverty
		  neighborhoods. We present new evidence on the impacts
		  ofMTOon children's long-term outcomes using administrative
		  data from tax returns. We find that moving to a
		  lower-poverty neighborhood significantly improves college
		  attendance rates and earnings for children who were young
		  (below age 13) when their families moved. These children
		  also live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults and
		  are less likely to become single parents. The treatment
		  effects are substantial: children whose families take up an
		  experimental voucher to move to a lower-poverty area when
		  they are less than 13 years old have an annual income that
		  is {\$}3,477 (31{\%}) higher on average relative to a mean
		  of {\$}11,270 in the control group in their mid-twenties.
		  In contrast, the same moves have, if anything, negative
		  long-term impacts on children who are more than 13 years
		  old when their families move, perhaps because of the
		  disruption effects of moving to a very different
		  environment. The gains from moving fall with the age when
		  children move, consistent with recent evidence that the
		  duration of exposure to a better environment during
		  childhood is a key determinant of an individual's long-term
		  outcomes. The findings imply that offering vouchers to move
		  to lower-poverty neighborhoods to families with young
		  children who are living in high- poverty housing projects
		  may reduce the intergenerational persistence of poverty and

		  The spatial function is the summation of the membership
		  function in the neighborhood of each pixel under
		  consideration. The advantages of the new method are the
		  following: (1) it yields regions more homogeneous than
		  those of other methods, (2) it reduces the spurious blobs,
		  (3) it removes noisy spots, and (4) it is less sensitive to
		  noise than other techniques. This technique is a powerful
		  method for noisy image segmentation and works for both

	Abstract = {Agglomeration economies are a persistent subject of debate
		  among economists and urban planners. Their definition turns
		  on whether or not larger cities and regions are more
		  efficient and more productive than smaller ones. We
		  complement existing discussion on agglomeration economies
		  and the urban wage premium here by providing a sensitivity
		  analysis of estimated coefficients to different
		  delineations of urban agglomeration as well as to different
		  definitions of the economic measure that summarises the
		  urban premium. This quantity can consist of total wages
		  measured at the place of work, or of income registered at
		  the place of residence. The chosen option influences the
		  scaling behaviour of city size as well as the spatial
		  distribution of the phenomenon at the city level. Spatial
		  discrepancies between the distribution of jobs and the
		  distribution of households at different economic levels
		  makes city definitions crucial to the estimation of
		  economic relations which vary with city size. We argue this
		  point by regressing measures of income and wage over about
		  five thousands different definitions of cities in France,
		  based on our algorithmic aggregation of administrative
		  spatial units at regular cutoffs which reflect density,
		  population thresholds and commuting flows. We also go
		  beyond aggregated observations of wages and income by
		  searching for evidence of larger inequalities and economic
		  segregation in the largest cities. This paper therefore
		  considers the spatial and economic complexity of cities
		  with respect to discussion about how we measure
		  agglomeration economies. It provides a basis for reflection
		  on alternative ways to model the processes which lead to
		  observed variations, and this can provide insights for more

		  Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among evicted tenants in
		  high-poverty neighborhoods, this article presents a new
		  explanation for urban survival, one that emphasizes the

		  To meet their most pressing needs, evicted families often
		  relied more on new acquaintances than on kin. Disposable
		  ties facilitated the flow of various resources, but often
		  bonds were brittle and fleet- ing. The strategy of forming,

		  methodology that combines Geo-SOM and hierarchical
		  clustering to tackle this problem. Geo-SOM was used to
		  ``divide'' the dataset into several homogeneous subsets;
		  hierarchical clustering was then used to ``group''
		  neighboring homogeneous subsets for pattern exploration in
		  different levels of granularity, thus permitting
		  exploration of patterns at multiple scales. An artificial

		  As a case study, the rush hour motorcycle flow data in

		  result generated solely by Geo-SOM, the proposed method
		  performed better in capturing the homogeneous zones in the
		  artificial dataset. For the case study, the proposed method
		  discovered six clusters with unique data and spatial
		  patterns at different levels of granularity, while the
		  original Geo-SOM only identified two. Among the four

There follows a discussion of how this `composite commodity' de? nition relates to the planning challenge of spatially bounding neighbourhood. The paper then probes the myriad idiosyncrasies associated with the concept of neighbourhood: cross-attribute variation in durability and ability to be priced, relativistic evaluations of attributes and consumption impacts on attributes. It discusses how, within this new paradigmatic context, neighbourhoods are produced by the same actors that consume them: households, property owners, business people and local government. Finally, consideration is given to various aspects of the origins and nature of neighbourhood change and it is argued that neighbourhood dynamics are rife with social inef? ciencies.},

	Abstract = {Inequalities among individuals and house- holds in
		  achieved socioeconomic status (in- come, wealth, and so on)
		  in the United States have reached levels not observed for
		  almost a century. We believe that a corresponding evo-
		  lution of geographic inequalities in socioeco- nomic,
		  environmental, institutional, and po- litical domains both
		  reflect and---more importantly from our
		  perspective---contribute to these inequalities across
		  individuals.1 It is this belief that motivated the Russell
		  Sage Foundation to devote an issue of RSF: The Rus- sell
		  Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sci- ences to this
		  topic. Our primary purpose in this introductory article is
		  to develop a holistic, multilevel con- ceptual model for
		  comprehending how space can be considered a foundation of
		  U.S. socio- economic inequality. Our secondary aim is to
		  provide a synthetic review of the evidence on various
		  dimensions of inequality of opportu- nity and outcomes in
		  America, and the empir- ical scholarly literature that
		  provides plausibly causal estimates of the impact of space
		  on in- dividual socioeconomic outcomes. We do not advance
		  new empirical research but rather a framing of the issues
		  that will be sufficiently robust and comprehensive to
		  permit integra- tion of all the papers in this issue as
		  illustra- tions and amplifications. Moreover, we hope that
		  our model will be useful in generating hy- potheses and
		  thereby stimulating further re- search on this crucial
		  topic. In overview, our conceptual model con- tends that
		  the variations in geographic context across multiple scales
		  (neighborhood, jurisdic- tion, metropolitan region)---what
		  we call spa- tial opportunity structure---affects the
		  socioeco- nomic outcomes that individuals can achieve in
		  two ways by altering the payoffs that will be gained from
		  the attributes individuals have during any given period and
		  the bundle of at- tributes that individuals will acquire
		  (both pas- sively and actively) during their lifetimes.},

@article{gaudart2015,
	Abstract = {Spatial cluster detection is a classical question in
		  epidemiology: Are cases located near other cases? In order
		  to classify a study area into zones of different risks and
		  determine their boundaries, we have developed a spatial
		  partitioning method based on oblique de-cision trees, which
		  is called spatial oblique decision tree (SpODT). This
		  non-parametric method is based on the classification and
		  regression tree (CART) approach introduced by Leo Breiman.
		  Applied to epidemiological spatial data, the algorithm
		  recursively searches among the coordinates for a threshold
		  or a boundary between zones, so that the risks estimated in
		  these zones are as different as possible. While the CART
		  algorithm leads to rectangular zones, providing
		  perpendicular splits of longitudes and latitudes, the SpODT
		  algorithm provides oblique splitting of the study area,
		  which is more appropriate and accu-rate for spatial
		  epidemiology. Oblique decision trees can be considered as
		  non-parametric regression models. Beyond the basic
		  function, we have developed a set of functions that enable
		  extended analyses of spatial data, providing: inference,
		  graphical representations, spatio-temporal analysis,
		  adjustments on covariates, spatial weighted partition, and
		  the gathering of similar adjacent final classes. In this
		  paper, we propose a new R package, SPODT, which provides an
		  extensible set of functions for partitioning spatial and
		  spatio-temporal data. The implementation and extensions of
		  the algorithm are described. Func-tion usage examples are
		  proposed, looking for clustering malaria episodes in
		  Bandiagara, Mali, and samples showing three different
		  cluster shapes.},

		  objects into a number of spatially contiguous regions while
		  optimizing an objective function, which is normally a
		  homogeneity (or heterogeneity) measure of the derived
		  regions. This research proposes and evaluates a family of
		  six hierarchical regionalization methods. The six methods
		  are based on three agglomerative clustering approaches,
		  including the single linkage, average linkage (ALK), and
		  the complete linkage (CLK), each of which is constrained
		  with spatial contiguity in two different ways (i.e. the
		  first-order constraining and the full-order constraining).
		  It is discovered that both the Full-Order-CLK and the
		  Full-Order-ALK methods significantly outperform existing
		  methods across four quality evaluations: the total
		  heterogeneity, region size balance, internal variation, and
		  the preservation of data distribution. Moreover, the
		  proposed algorithms are efficient and can find the solution
		  in O(n{\^{}}2log n) time. With such data scalability, for
		  the first time it is possible to effectively regionalize

	Abstract = {High-resolution spatial data have become increasingly
		  available with modern data collection techniques and
		  efforts. However, it is often inappropriate to use the
		  default geographic units to perform spatial analysis due to
		  unstable estimates with small areas (e.g. cancer rates for
		  census blocks or tracts). Regionalization is aggregating
		  small units into relatively larger areas while optimizing a
		  homogeneity measure (such as the sum of squared
		  differences). For exploratory spatial analysis,
		  regionalization may help remove spurious data variation
		  through aggregation and discover hidden patterns in data
		  (such as areas of unusually high cancer rates). Towards
		  this goal, this research introduces several improvements to
		  a recent group of regionalization methods -- REDCAP (Guo
		  2008) and conducts evaluation experiments with synthetic
		  data sets to assess and compare the capability of
		  regionalization methods for exploratory spatial analysis.
		  One of the major improvements is the integration of a local
		  empirical Bayes smoother (EBS) with the regionalization
		  methods. We generate a large number of synthetic data sets
		  with controlled spatial patterns to evaluate the
		  performance of both new and existing methods. Evaluation

	Abstract = {Geodemographics as the ``analysis of people by where they

		  and is experiencing a renaissance in applied spatial
		  demography. However, some commentators have expressed
		  reservations about the statistical limitations of common

		  potential internal heterogeneity of the geodemographic
		  groupings, as well as the problem of clearly identifying
		  predictor variables that might account for or explain the

		  In this paper we argue that geodemographic typologies are
		  structured methods for making sense of the spatial and
		  socioeconomic patterns encoded within complex datasets such
		  as national census data. By treating geodemographics as
		  more a framework than a tool for analysis in its own right

		  demonstrate this with a case study of whether pupils from
		  different types of neighborhood in Birmingham, England are
		  more or less likely to attend their nearest state-funded
		  secondary school and how that likelihood varies with the

	Abstract = {Clustering constitutes one of the most popular and
		  important tasks in data analysis. This is true for any type
		  of data, and geographic data is no exception. In fact, in
		  geographic knowledge discovery the aim is, more often than
		  not, to explore and let spatial patterns surface rather
		  than develop predictive models. The size and dimensionality
		  of the existing and future databases stress the need for
		  efficient and robust clustering algorithms. This need has
		  been successfully addressed in the context of
		  general-purpose knowledge discovery. Geographic knowledge
		  discovery, nonetheless can still benefit from better tools,
		  especially if these tools are able to integrate geographic
		  information and aspatial variables in order to assist the
		  geographic analyst's objectives and needs. Typically, the
		  objectives are related with finding spatial patterns based
		  on the interaction between location and aspatial variables.
		  When performing cluster-based analysis of geographic data,
		  user interaction is essential to understand and explore the
		  emerging patterns, and the lack of appropriate tools for
		  this task hinders a lot of otherwise very good work.In this
		  paper, we present the GeoSOM suite as a tool designed to
		  bridge the gap between clustering and the typical
		  geographic information science objectives and needs. The
		  GeoSOM suite implements the GeoSOM algorithm, which changes
		  the traditional Self-Organizing Map algorithm to explicitly
		  take into account geographic information. We present a case
		  study, based on census data from Lisbon, exploring the

	Abstract = {Objectives: Previous criminological scholarship has
		  posited that network ties among neighborhood residents may
		  impact crime rates, but has done little to consider the
		  specific ways in which network structure may enhance or
		  inhibit criminal activity. A lack of data on social ties
		  has arguably led to this state of affairs. We propose to
		  avoid this limitation by demonstrating a novel approach of
		  extrapolatively simulating network ties and constructing
		  structural network measures to assess their effect on
		  neighborhood crime rates. Methods: We first spatially
		  locate the households of a city into their constituent
		  blocks. Then, we employ spatial interaction functions based
		  on prior empirical work and simulate a network of social
		  ties among these residents. From this simulated network, we
		  compute network statistics that more appropriately capture
		  the notions of cohesion and information diffusion that
		  underlie theories of networks and crime. Results: We show
		  that these network statistics are robust predictors of the
		  levels of crime in five separate cities (above standard
		  controls) at the very micro geographic level of blocks and
		  block groups. Conclusions: We conclude by considering
		  extensions of the approach that account for homophily in
		  the formation of network ties. {\textcopyright} 2013

	Abstract = {Spatial optimization techniques are commonly used for
		  regionalization problems, often represented as p-regions
		  problems. Although various spatial optimization approaches
		  have been proposed for finding exact solutions to p-regions
		  problems, these approaches are not practical when applied
		  to large-size problems. Alternatively, various heuristics
		  provide effective ways to find near-optimal solutions for
		  p-regions problem. However, most heuristic approaches are
		  specifically designed for particular geographic settings.
		  This paper proposes a new heuristic approach named
		  Automated Zoning Procedure-Center Interchange (AZP-CI) to
		  solve the p-functional regions problem (PFRP), which
		  constructs regions by combining small areas that share
		  common characteristics with predefined functional centers
		  and have tight connections among themselves through spatial
		  interaction. The AZP-CI consists of two subprocesses.
		  First, the dissolving/splitting process enhances
		  diversification and thereby produces an extensive
		  exploration of the solution space. Second, the standard AZP
		  locally improves the objective value. The AZP-CI was tested
		  using randomly simulated datasets and two empirical

	Abstract = {Spatio-temporal clustering is a process of grouping
		  objects based on their spatial and temporal similarity. It
		  is relatively new subfield of data mining which gained high
		  popularity especially in geographic information sciences
		  due to the pervasiveness of all kinds of location-based or
		  environmental devices that record position, time or/and
		  environmental properties of an object or set of objects in
		  real-time. As a consequence, different types and large
		  amounts of spatio-temporal data became available that
		  introduce new challenges to data analysis and require novel
		  approaches to knowledge discovery. In this chapter we
		  concentrate on the spatio-temporal clustering in geographic
		  space. First, we provide a classification of different
		  types of spatio-temporal data. Then, we focus on one type
		  of spatio-temporal clustering - trajectory clustering,
		  provide an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches and
		  methods of spatio-temporal clustering and finally present
		  several scenarios in different application domains such as
		  movement, cellular networks and environmental studies.},

		  persistent patterns of racial residential segregation in

		  bring a new perspective -- and new data from the 2004
		  Detroit Area Study -- to the question of how best to
		  characterize black and white preferences toward living in
		  neighborhoods with people of different races. White and
		  black residents of the Detroit metropolitan area (n = 734)
		  were asked in an area probability sample survey about their
		  evaluations of 33 actual communities throughout their metro
		  area. These evaluations are used as an indirect measure of
		  racial residential preferences by viewing how race -- both
		  of the respondent and of the community -- shapes them. We
		  find modest racial agreement about which communities would
		  be "seriously considered" and "never considered" as a place
		  to live, but by and large perceptions of the metropolis are
		  racialized. Whites are influenced by the percentage white
		  in a community (net of the community's social class
		  characteristics) and very unlikely to consider communities
		  where they are anything but the strong majority. African
		  Americans are also influenced by race, but in different
		  ways and less fundamentally: 1.) Communities with high
		  percentages of African Americans are among those most
		  likely to be "seriously considered," but so are communities
		  with just a handful of African Americans; 2.) African
		  Americans are less likely to "never consider" all
		  communities, and more likely than whites to consider both
		  communities where they are in the majority and in the
		  minority; 3.) African Americans are unaffected by a
		  community's percent white net of community social class
		  characteristics. We place these results in the context of
		  the debate about racial residential preferences, arguing

	Abstract = {Due to the complexity and multidimensional characteristics
		  of human activities, assessing the similarity of human
		  activity patterns and classifying individuals with similar

		  new and unique methodology for evaluating the similarity
		  among individual activity patterns. It conceptualizes
		  multidimensional sequence alignment (MDSA) as a
		  multiobjective optimization problem, and solves this
		  problem with an evolutionary algorithm. The study utilizes
		  sequence alignment to code multiple facets of human
		  activities into multidimensional sequences, and to treat
		  similarity assessment as a multiobjective optimization
		  problem that aims to minimize the alignment cost for all
		  dimensions simultaneously. A multiobjective optimization
		  evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to generate a diverse
		  set of optimal or near-optimal alignment solutions.
		  Evolutionary operators are specifically designed for this
		  problem, and a local search method also is incorporated to
		  improve the search ability of the algorithm. We demonstrate
		  the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with a
		  popular existing method called ClustalG using a set of 50
		  sequences. The results indicate that our method outperforms

	Abstract = {This working paper is a reflection on the conditions
		  required to use optimal matching (OM) in social sciences.
		  Despite its striking success in biology, optimal matching
		  was not invented to solve biological questions but computer
		  science ones: OM is a family of distance concepts
		  originating in information and coding theory were it is
		  known under various names among which Hamming, and
		  Levenshtein distance. As a consequence, the success of this
		  method in biology has nothing to do with the alleged
		  similarity of the way it operates with biological processes
		  but with choices of parameters in accordance with the kind
		  of materials and questions biologists are facing. As
		  materials and questions differ in social sciences, it is
		  not possible to import OM directly from biology. The very
		  basic fact that sequences of social events are not made of
		  biological matter but of events and time is crucial for the
		  adaptation of OM: insertion and deletion operations warp
		  time and are to be avoided if information regarding the
		  social regulation of the timing of event is to be fully
		  recovered. A formulation of substitution costs taking
		  advantage of the social structuration of time is proposed
		  for sequences sharing the same calendar: dynamic
		  substitution costs can be derived from the series of
		  transition matrices describing social sub-rhythms. An
		  application to the question of the scheduling of work is
		  proposed: using data from the 1985-86 and 1998-99 French
		  time-use surveys, twelve types of workdays are uncovered.
		  Their interpretability and quality, assessed visually
		  through aggregate and individual tempograms, and box plots,
		  seem satisfactory. Ce document de travail se veut une
		  r{\'{e}}flexion sur les conditions d'utilisation des

		  higher this ratio, the closer OM is to the Levenshtein II
		  distance, which amounts to finding the longest common
		  subsequence. When the timing of sequences is crucial,
		  substitutions should be favored over indels and their costs
		  should be carefully fixed. Ideally, substitution costs
		  should vary with time to better take into account the
		  timing of the sequences studied. As indels warp time, hence
		  the timing of sequences, it is suggested to use only
		  substitution operations with time-dependent costs inversely
		  proportional to transition frequencies whenever the timing
		  of sequences is central. This OM variant, coined dynamic
		  Hamming matching, is applied to the question of the
		  scheduling of paid work where timing is critical (1985 and
		  1999 French time use surveys, N = 7,908) along with three
		  classical OM variants (Hamming and Levenshtein I and II).
		  As expected, the two Hamming dissimilarity measures fare
		  better to identify patterns of workday schedules, as
		  measured by entropy, than the two Levenshtein ones. ER -},

	Abstract = {The p-compact-regions problem, defined by Li, Church, and
		  Goodchild (forthcoming) involves generating a fixed number
		  ( p) of regions from n atomic polygonal units with the
		  objective of maximizing the compactness of each region.
		  Compactness is a shape factor measuring how closely and
		  firmly the polygonal units in a region are packed together.
		  A compact polygonal region has the advantages of being
		  homogeneous and maximizing the accessibility of all points
		  within that region, therefore it is useful in a large
		  number of real-world applications, such as in conservation
		  planning, political district partitioning, and the proposed
		  application in this paper concerning regionalization for
		  urban economic modeling. This paper reports our efforts in
		  designing an object-oriented heuristic framework that
		  integrates semi-greedy growth and local search to solve a
		  real-world applied p-compact-regions problem to optimality
		  or near-optimality. We apply this model to support urban
		  economic simulation, in which activities need to be
		  aggregated from the 4109 Transportation Analysis Zones
		  (TAZs) of six southern California counties into 100 regions
		  to achieve desired computational feasibility of the
		  economic simulation model. Spatial contiguity,
		  physiography, political boundaries, the presence of local
		  centers, and intra-zonal and inter-zonal traffic are
		  considered, and efforts are made to ensure consistency of
		  selected properties between the disaggregated and
		  aggregated regions. This work makes an original
		  contribution in the development of a highly extendable and
		  effective solution framework to allow researchers to
		  investigate large, real, non-linear regionalization

	Abstract = {The development of new spatial methods has heightened
		  long-standing interest in the local organization of urban
		  life. This growth in empirical research has run ahead of
		  theories about the nature of local space: to a large
		  extent, contemporary sociology employs the same conceptions
		  of space developed in works of the Chicago School produced
		  between 1918 and the early 1930's. This article describes
		  three major notions of locality developed by the Chicago
		  School, respectively defined by ecology, institutions, and
		  subjective perceptions. These accounts of locality are not
		  theoretically consistent, and make reference to partially
		  distinct empirical phenomena. A brief survey of
		  contemporary neighborhood research reveals the persistence
		  of these spatial accounts, as well as uncertainty about the
		  goals of neighborhood research. Revisiting the accounts of
		  urban place developed by the Chicago School suggests five
		  distinct ends for research on locality: research programs
		  focusing specifically on ecology, institutions, or
		  perceptions; methodological and theoretical pluralism in
		  pursuit of maximally rich description; and empirical
		  integration seeking to describe the role of multiple
		  processes in the production of local space.},

@article{modai-snir2061,
	Abstract = {Neighbourhood socioeconomic change is a complex phenomenon
		  which is driven by multiple processes. Most research has
		  focused on the role of urban-level processes, which lead to
		  an exchange of relative positions among neighbourhoods of a
		  single metropolitan area. Consequently, the effects of
		  struc-tural processes on neighbourhood socioeconomic
		  change, such as overall income growth or decline, and
		  increasing inequality, have been neglected. This is
		  reflected in the standard methodological practices; the
		  common measures of neighbourhood change exclude the effect
		  of overall growth or decline and confound the effects of
		  urban processes with the effect of increase in inequality.
		  This paper proposes a method that was originally developed
		  for understanding income mobility of indi-viduals, to
		  decompose total neighbourhood socioeconomic change measured
		  in absolute terms into its contributing components. The
		  approach enables to take account of all processes that
		  generate neighbourhood socioeconomic change, while
		  distinguishing between them. The method is demonstrated in
		  an empirical analysis of neighbourhood socioeconomic change
		  across 22 metropolitan areas in the US. The findings
		  indicate that structural processes can be most substantial
		  in generating change. Neighbourhood socioeconomic change in
		  'superstar cities' is mostly gen-erated by the growth in
		  overall incomes, with a relatively low contribution of
		  increasing inequality. Conversely, in declining cities it
		  is mostly driven by overall decline and increasing
		  inequality. An additional finding relates to the
		  interaction between urban processes and increasing
		  inequality. These processes work in oppo-site directions
		  such that any increase in positions of low-income
		  neighbourhoods can be totally offset by an income decrease
		  due to increasing inequality.},

		  neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP). There is a need
		  to identify specific features of neighborhoods relevant to
		  disease risk, but few measures of these features exist, and
		  their measurement properties are understudied. In this
		  paper, the authors 1) develop measures (scales) of
		  neighborhood environment that are important in
		  cardiovascular disease risk, 2) assess the psychometric and
		  ecometric properties of these measures, and 3) examine
		  individual- and neighborhood-level predictors of these
		  measures. In 2004, data on neighborhood conditions were
		  collected from a telephone survey of 5,988 residents at
		  three US study sites (Baltimore, Maryland; Forsyth County,
		  North Carolina; and New York, New York). Information
		  collected covered seven dimensions of neighborhood
		  environment (aesthetic quality, walking environment,
		  availability of healthy foods, safety, violence, social
		  cohesion, and activities with neighbors). Neighborhoods
		  were defined as census tracts or census clusters.
		  Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranged from 0.73 to 0.83, with
		  test-retest reliabilities of 0.60-0.88. Intraneighborhood
		  correlations were 0.28-0.51, and neighborhood reliabilities
		  were 0.64-0.78 for census tracts for most scales. The
		  neighborhood scales were strongly associated with
		  neighborhood SEP but also provided information distinct
		  from neighborhood SEP. These results illustrate a
		  methodological approach for assessing the measurement
		  properties of neighborhood-level constructs and show that
		  these constructs can be measured reliably.},

	Abstract = {One major methodological problem in analysis of sequence
		  data is the determination of costs from which distances
		  between sequences are derived. Although this problem is
		  currently not optimally dealt with in the social sciences,
		  it has some similarity with problems that have been solved
		  in bioinformatics for three decades. In this article, the
		  authors propose an optimization of substitution and
		  deletion/insertion costs based on computational methods.
		  The authors provide an empirical way of determining costs
		  for cases, frequent in the social sciences, in which theory
		  does not clearly promote one cost scheme over another.
		  Using three distinct data sets, the authors tested the
		  distances and cluster solutions produced by the new cost
		  scheme in comparison with solutions based on cost schemes
		  associated with other research strategies. The proposed
		  method performs well compared with other cost-setting
		  strategies, while it alleviates the justification problem
		  of cost schemes.},

		  main contributions. First, we propose a new clustering
		  method called CLARANS, whose aim is to identify spatial
		  structures that may be present in the data. Experimental
		  results indicate that, when compared with existing
		  clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and
		  effective. Second, we investigate how CLARANS can handle
		  not only points objects, but also polygon objects
		  efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the
		  IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex
		  and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of
		  CLARANS, we develop two spatial data mining algorithms that
		  aim to discover relationships between spatial and

		  methodology, which uses visual analytical tools, is meant
		  to help researchers examine how local land-use
		  configurations shape minorities' residential dynamics and,
		  thereby, affect the level of minority--majority
		  segregation. This methodology responds to the need to refer
		  to the relationship between local land-use configurations
		  and the identity of a building's residents, without
		  simulta- neously revealing sensitive house-related details.
		  The research was instantiated on the residential patterns
		  exhibited by the Arab community in Jaffa, Israel. The
		  residential data were collected for over 40 years at four
		  different moments, each associated with the population and
		  housing censuses conducted by Israel's Central Bureau of

		  between spatial land-use configurations and rates of change

		  neighborhood change may lead to changing opportunities for
		  residents. Past research on neighborhood upgrading tends to
		  focus on one process: gentrification. I argue that a

		  requires examination. This article documents the different
		  types of neighborhoods ascending from 1970 to the present.
		  Using principal components analysis and cluster analysis, I
		  report the prevalence of socioeconomic ascent, based on
		  increases in neighborhood income, rents, house values, and
		  educational and occupational attainment, among five to
		  seven types of neighborhoods in each decade. I also examine
		  population and housing changes that co-occur with ascent to
		  identify processes of ascent beyond gentrification.
		  Overall, findings suggest mixed implications for
		  neighborhood inequality. While white suburban neighborhoods
		  make up the bulk of neighborhoods that ascend in each

		  increasingly likely to ascend over time, though

	Abstract = {In the factorial ecology of American cities, the labels
		  "socioeconomic status" and "life cycle" have been given to
		  the two principal axes on the basis of several consistently
		  related variables. If the general use of these names
		  implies recurring processes of housing choice and city
		  growth, which result in the observed residential patterns,
		  then all variables related to these processes should
		  exhibit consistent relationships to the principal axes. A
		  systematic comparison of the loadings of variables for ten
		  American cities reveals both consistencies and notable
		  differences in the relationships of attributes to the two
		  major dimensions. Careful attention to the characteristics
		  of the populations submitted to the technique of factorial
		  ecology is required to account for the variations, and may
		  suggest new or refined explanations for the spatial
		  relationships. Regional variations in social
		  stratification, demographic characteristics, occupational
		  structure, local housing market conditions and preferences,
		  city age, and morphology seem to account for many of the
		  differences.},

	Abstract = {Residential location search has become an important topic
		  to both practitioners and researchers as more detailed and
		  disaggregate land-use and transportation demand models are
		  developed which require information on individual household
		  location decisions. The housing search process starts with
		  an alternative formation and screening stage. At this level
		  households evaluate all potential alternatives based on
		  their lifestyle, preferences, and utilities to form a
		  manageable choice set with a limited number of plausible
		  alternatives. Then the final residential location is
		  selected among these alternatives. This two-stage decision
		  making process can be used for both aggregate zone-level
		  selection as well as searching disaggregate parcel or
		  building-based housing markets for potential dwellings. In
		  this paper a zonal level household housing search model is
		  developed. Initially, a household specific choice set is
		  drawn from the entire possible alternatives in the area
		  based on the average household work distance to each
		  alternative. Following the choice set formation step, a
		  discrete choice model is utilized for modeling the final
		  residential zone selection of the household. A hazard-based
		  model is used for the choice set formation module while the
		  final choice selection is modeled using a multinomial logit
		  formulation with a deterministic sample correction factor.
		  The approach presented in the paper provides a remedy for
		  the large choice set problem typically faced in housing
		  search models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the quantitative assessment of
		  ecological settings such as neighborhoods and schools.
		  Available administrative data typically provide useful but
		  limited information on such settings. We demonstrate how
		  more complete information can be reliably obtained from
		  surveys and observational studies. Survey-based assessments
		  are constructed by aggregating over multiple item responses
		  of multiple informants within each setting. Item and rater
		  inconsistency produce uncertainty about the setting being

		  Observation-based assessments also have a multilevel error
		  structure. The paper describes measures constructed from
		  interviews, direct observations, and videotapes of Chicago
		  neighborhoods and illustrates an ``ecometric''
		  analysis---a study of bias and random error in neighborhood
		  assessments. Using the observation data as an illustrative
		  example, we present a three-level hierarchical statistical
		  model that identifies sources of error in aggregating
		  across items within face-blocks and in aggregating across
		  face-blocks to larger geographic units such as census
		  tracts. Convergent and divergent validity are evaluated by

	Abstract = {This nationwide study of neighborhood racial and ethnic
		  transitions examines the varieties and dynamics of U.S.
		  neighborhood change between 1990 and 2000. The authors use
		  innovative and robust cluster analysis techniques to
		  classify U.S. census tracts in the 50 largest metropolitan
		  areas. We interpret the resulting clusters according to
		  their central tendencies and explore inter-metropolitan and
		  regional patterns in relative cluster frequencies. Finally,
		  we esti- mate multilevel logistic regression models of the
		  covariates of cluster membership. We conclude that within
		  cities, trends toward greater and potentially stable
		  diversity in some neighborhoods co-exist with continuing
		  White flight and re-segregation in other local areas.
		  Further, at both the metropolitan and neighborhood levels
		  increasing diversity is associated with the significant
		  pres- ence of multiple minorities, while white flight and
		  re-segregation are associated with the rapid growth of
		  either blacks or Hispanics. This variability in transition
		  outcomes can at least in part be attributed to demographic
		  structure at the metropolitan scale and to the distance
		  from established minority enclaves of the neighborhoods
		  themselves},

		  identifying ``neighborhoods'' a priori and then studying
		  how resident attributes change over time, this approach
		  looks at the neighborhood more intrinsically as a unit that

		  next. The approach is based on a spatial clustering
		  algorithm that identifies neighborhoods at two points in

		  demur, and would suggest that Sutherland's more profound

		  that individuals or individual characteristics are
		  unimportant, but rather that much can be learned, and
		  possibly changed, by focusing on community and social

@article{sharkey2010,
	Abstract = {Two landmark policy interventions to improve the lives of
		  youth through neighborhood mobility ---the Gautreaux
		  program in Chicago and the Moving to Opportunity
		  experiments in five cities--- have produced conflicting
		  results and created a puzzle with broad implications: Do
		  residential moves between neighborhoods increase or
		  decrease violence, or both? To address this question we
		  analyze data from a subsample of adolescents ages 9--12
		  from the Project on Human Development in Chicago
		  Neighborhoods, a longitudinal study of children and their
		  families that began in Chicago, the site of the original
		  Gautreaux program and one of the MTO experiments. We
		  propose a dynamic modeling strategy to separate the effects
		  of residential moving over three waves of the study from
		  dimensions of neighborhood change and metropolitan
		  location. The results reveal countervailing effects of
		  mobility on trajectories of violence: Whereas neighborhood
		  moves within Chicago lead to an elevated risk of violence,
		  moves outside of the city reduce violent offending and
		  exposure to violence. The gap in violence between movers
		  within and outside Chicago is explained not only by the
		  racial and economic composition of the destination
		  neighborhoods, but the quality of school contexts,
		  adolescents' perceived control over their new environment,
		  and fear. These findings highlight the need to consider
		  simultaneously residential mobility, mechanisms of
		  neighborhood change, and the wider geography of structural
		  opportunity.},

		  neighborhoods and educational and cognitive outcomes as an
		  example, the research we review suggests that any attempt
		  to reduce the literature to a single answer about whether

		  quite often is one of increasing intensity with distance

	Abstract = {Dasymetric areal interpolation is the process by which data are transferred from a spatial unit system for which they are available (source units) to another system for which they are required (target units) with the aid of ancillary information (control units). We propose a spatially disaggregated areal interpolation model for population data using light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived building volumes as an ancillary variable. Innovative methods are proposed for model initialization, iterative regression and adjustment, and stopping criteria to deal effectively with control units of unequal size. The model is derived and applied at the control unit level to minimize the modifiable areal unit problem, and an iterative adjustment process is utilized to overcome the spatial heterogeneity problem encountered in earlier approaches. The use of building volume to disaggregate the popu- lation into finer scales ensures maximum correspondence with the unit at which the original population data were collected and models not only the horizontal but also the vertical population distribution. A case study for Round Rock, Texas, demonstrates that the pro- posed spatially disaggregated model using LiDAR-derived building volumes outperforms earlier areal interpolation models using traditional area- and length-based ancillary variables.},

@article{stojanova2013,
	Abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is the correlation among data
		  values which is strictly due to the relative spatial
		  proximity of the objects that the data refer to.
		  Inappropriate treatment of data with spatial dependencies,
		  where spatial autocorrelation is ignored, can obfuscate
		  important insights. In this paper, we propose a data mining
		  method that explicitly considers spatial autocorrelation in
		  the values of the response (target) variable when learning
		  predictive clustering models. The method is based on the
		  concept of predictive clustering trees (PCTs), according to
		  which hierarchies of clusters of similar data are
		  identified and a predictive model is associated to each
		  cluster. In particular, our approach is able to learn
		  predictive models for both a continuous response
		  (regression task) and a discrete response (classification
		  task). We evaluate our approach on several real world
		  problems of spatial regression and spatial classification.
		  The consideration of the autocorrelation in the models
		  improves predictions that are consistently clustered in
		  space and that clusters try to preserve the spatial
		  arrangement of the data, at the same time providing a
		  multi-level insight into the spatial autocorrelation
		  phenomenon. The evaluation of SCLUS in several ecological
		  domains (e.g. predicting outcrossing rates within a
		  conventional field due to the surrounding genetically
		  modified fields, as well as predicting pollen dispersal
		  rates from two lines of plants) confirms its capability of
		  building spatial aware models which capture the spatial
		  distribution of the target variable. In general, the maps
		  obtained by using SCLUS do not require further
		  post-smoothing of the results if we want to use them in
		  practice. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

	Abstract = {This article illustrates the challenges and potential
		  advantages associated with using a sequence-based method to
		  describe the structure of individual residential mobility
		  histories. The authors examine the existence and prevalence
		  of distinctive patterns of residential mobility across a
		  rural-suburban-urban place-type continuum. They identify a
		  finite set of empirically common residential trajectories
		  that describe patterns of movement across the geographic
		  landscape. This approach reveals (1) a great deal of
		  stability in patterns of residential attachment; (2) that
		  residential movement is frequently organized in terms of
		  place-type, rather than in terms of specific locations; and
		  (3) that certain place-types are rarely linked together in
		  residential histories, which suggests that the universe of
		  place-types contains social boundaries. Combining the
		  empirically observed residential trajectories with basic
		  demographic characteristics of individuals confirms general
		  expectations from the life course perspective about the
		  roles and positions individuals occupy over different
		  stages of adulthood.},

The address weighting (AW) and parcel distribution (PD) methods are based on county address points and parcels. The algorithms can be effectively applied in rural and transitional areas where geographies are large and population counts are low. These new methods were compared to existing algorithms that use nationally available land cover and street network datasets. Compared with existing methods, the new methods yielded significant improvement in reducing estimate error for the study areas. Both new methods succeeded in maintaining high accuracy in both urban and rural areas. The research presents opportunities for increasing the accuracy of both areal interpolation and dasymetric mapping in areas where accurate local data are available.},

		  Simulations run with the model are based on various

		  demonstrated through application of the model to a

	Abstract = {Sequences of characters are used in many fields to record
		  events or processes that characterize social processes.
		  However, until recently, there have been very few methods

		  Alignment algorithms measure similarities between pairs of

		  the best possible matching pattern. In this paper the
		  reliability of alignments in the classification of
		  sequential data is examined. Alignment methods were
		  developed in computational biology, but are being
		  considered for applications in other fields such as
		  sociology, geography, and transportation planning. The
		  ClustalG multiple alignment package is used to examine a
		  set of synthetic sequences generated through the use of
		  eight separate generation rules. Through the application of
		  the software to sequential data with a known number of
		  subgroups and known patterns in the sequences, some
		  strategies for conducting the analysis can be compared and
		  evaluated. The most effective strategy for analysing
		  sequential data when the underlying processes that generate

	Abstract = {Recent inquiry in urban studies highlights the dynamic
		  restructuring of urban areas, with new elements of the
		  landscape taken as reflections of sweeping economic and
		  sociocultural change. American cities are portrayed as
		  "galactic" and "restless" manifestations of global and
		  national industrial restructuring, widening income
		  inequality, demographic shifts, and the cultural
		  sensibilities of new class formations. Yet the persistence
		  of residential segregation and suburban develop- ment
		  processes provide reminders of the historical continuity of
		  American urban form. This paper critically evaluates
		  continuity and change in the urban landscape, drawing on
		  feminist urban research and theories of residential
		  differentiation to analyze changes in spatial segregation
		  among families and households. I apply the methods of the
		  classical factorial ecology literature to a special census
		  tabulation that controls for tract boundary changes between
		  1980 and 1990. The analysis focuses on Minneapolis-St.
		  Paul, which exemplifies processes of industrial restruc-
		  turing and suburban development and an unusually high rate
		  of female labor force participation. Results indicate that
		  urban demographic trends have inscribed increasingly
		  complex patterns of neighborhood segregation. The delayed
		  child- bearing, increased employment, and high household
		  incomes of married women of the baby boom generation have
		  altered the 1960s "family status" construct. I offer a
		  theory of the "public household" to illuminate this
		  transformation, which entails an erosion of the boundaries
		  between markets and family life as households con- front
		  the contradictions of suburban built environments. The
		  foundations of resi- dential differentiation display
		  remarkable continuity, and the public household is rooted
		  in long-term demographic trends, widening inequality, and
		  increasing con- sumption standards driven by postwar
		  suburbanization and housing policy. Ultimately,
		  restlessness in the urban landscape is a story of dynamic
		  stability, as tur- bulent social and institutional change
		  reflects the struggles of workers and families adjusting to
		  the imperatives of life in a low-density urban
		  environment.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies a methodology for hierarchical spatial
		  clustering of contiguous polygons, based on a geographic
		  coordinate system. The studied algorithm is built upon a
		  modification of traditional hierarchical clustering
		  algorithms, commonly used in the multivariate analysis
		  literature. According to the method studied in this paper,
		  at each step of the sequential process of collapsing
		  clusters, only neighboring clusters (groups of original
		  polygons, i.e. municipalities, census tracts, states) are
		  allowed to be collapsed to form a bigger cluster. Two types
		  of neighborhood are used: polygons with one edge in common
		  (rook neighborhood) or polygons with at least one point in
		  common (queen neighborhood). In this paper, the methodology
		  is employed to create clusters of Brazilian municipalities,
		  for the year 2000, based on a group of socio-economic
		  variables. Several clustering methods are investigated, as
		  well as several types of vector distances. The studied
		  methods were: centroid method, single linkage, complete
		  linkage, average linkage, average linkage weighted, Ward
		  minimum variance and median method. The studied distances
		  were: L p norm (particularly, L 1 and L 2 norms),
		  Mahalanobis distance and variance corrected Euclidian
		  distance. Finally, a discussion on selection of the number
		  of clusters is presented.},

@article{Xie1995,
	Abstract = {In economic, social, and urban studies, areal units under analysis frequently differ from areal units over which data are compiled. Most area-based analyses, hence, face an unavoidable problem of transferring data across different zonal systems. This paper introduces a novel approach, the overlaid network algorithm, to develop a series of improved methods for tackling the population interpolation problem based on current GIS techniques and available digital information. The term network means that the partitioning of population for source zones is carried out over street segments. People are sheltered by houses which are located along the sides of streets or connected by roads. Thus, the street network provides an important information about the spatial distribution of population. The network length method discerns an even population distribution along one-dimensional line. The network hierarchical weighting method observes variations of residential density among different classes of streets. The network house bearing method breaks the assumptions of even population distribution over one and two dimensions and provides an automatic way of enumerating population over space. The application of these techniques to the interpolation of population in Erie County, New York improves the performance of areal interpolation significantly when compared with traditional methods. {\textcopyright} 1996.},

@article{zscheischler2012,
	Abstract = {Classifying the land surface according to different
		  climate zones is often a prerequisite for global diagnostic
		  or predictive modelling studies. Classical classifications
		  such as the prominent K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger (KG) approach
		  rely on heuristic decision rules. Although these heuristics
		  may transport some process understanding, such a
		  discretization may appear "arbitrary" from a data oriented
		  perspective. In this contribution we compare the precision
		  of a KG classification to an unsupervised classification
		  (k-means clustering). Generally speaking, we revisit the
		  problem of "climate classification" by investigating the
		  inherent patterns in multiple data streams in a purely data
		  driven way. One question is whether we can reproduce the KG
		  boundaries by exploring different combinations of climate
		  and remotely sensed vegetation variables. In this context
		  we also investigate whether climate and vegetation
		  variables build similar clusters. In terms of statistical
		  performances, k-means clearly outperforms classical climate
		  classifications. However, a subsequent stability analysis
		  only reveals a meaningful number of clusters if both
		  climate and vegetation data are considered in the analysis.
		  This is a setback for the hope to explain vegetation by
		  means of climate alone. Clearly, classification schemes
		  like K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger will play an important role in the
		  future. However, future developments in this area need to
		  be assessed based on data driven approaches.

	Abstract = {This article develops an integrated methodology to investigate 
                dominant trajectories of neighborhood change that are often 
                confronted in urban studies. Currently, researchers are using
                k-means cluster analysis to establish diverse neighborhood 
                typologies and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify
                socioeconomic interactions explaining the neighborhood typologies.
                Little attention has been given to longitudinal trajectories and
                dynamics of neighborhood evolution over a long period. Our new 
                model adapts a newly developed dynamic sequential analysis 
                (the weighted minimum edit distance algorithm) in big data analytics 
                to sort and identify dominant trajectories of neighborhood change. 
                Our model also innovatively synthesizes three statistical procedures---k-means,
                PCA, and analysis of variance---to derive the weight matrix, which 
                naturally integrates the core characteristics of urban neighborhood
                changes into the sequential reordering. Using the census data in
                Metro Detroit over five census years (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010),
                this model was tested to identify a unique city's demographic and 
                socioeconomic transition pattern in the past forty years. This model 
                successfully provided a thorough analysis of the neighborhood 
                typologies and exhibited a much-enhanced performance in identifying 
                long-term trajectories of urban evolution.},
