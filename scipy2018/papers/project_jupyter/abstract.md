abstract: Binder is an open source web service that lets users create sharable,
  interactive, reproducible environments in the cloud. It is powered by other
  core projects in the open source ecosystem, including JupyterHub and
  Kubernetes for managing cloud resources. Binder works with pre-existing
  workflows in the analytics community, aiming to create interactive versions of
  repositories that exist on sites like GitHub with minimal extra effort needed.
  This paper details several of the design decisions and goals that went into
  the development of the current generation of Binder.
