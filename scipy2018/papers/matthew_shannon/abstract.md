title: 'Organic Molecules in Space: Insights from the NASA Ames Molecular
  Database in the era of the James Webb Space Telescope'
description: We present the software tool pyPAHdb to the scientific astronomical
  community, which is used to characterize emission from one of the most
  prevalent types of organic molecules in space, namely polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons (PAHs).
abstract: We present the software tool pyPAHdb to the scientific astronomical
  community, which is used to characterize emission from one of the most
  prevalent types of organic molecules in space, namely polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons (PAHs). It leverages the detailed studies of organic molecules
  done at the NASA Ames Research Center. pyPAHdb is a streamlined Python version
  of the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb;
  www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb) suite of IDL tools. PAHdb has been extensively
  used to analyze and interpret the PAH signature from a plethora of emission
  sources, ranging from solar-system objects to entire galaxies. `pyPAHdb`
  decomposes astronomical PAH emission spectra into contributing PAH sub-classes
  in terms of charge and size using a database-fitting technique. The inputs for
  the fit are spectra constructed using the spectroscopic libraries of PAHdb and
  take into account the detailed photo-physics of the PAH excitation/emission
  process.
