abstract: Plotly.js is a declarative JavaScript data visualization library built
  on D3 and WebGL that supports a wide range of statistical, scientific,
  financial, geographic, and 3-dimensional visualizations. Support for creating
  Plotly.js visualizations from Python is provided by the `plotly.py` library.
  Version 3 of `plotly.py` integrates ipywidgets support, providing a host of
  benefits to `plotly.py` users working in the Jupyter notebook. This paper
  describes the architecture of this new version of `plotly.py`, and presents
  examples of several of these benefits.
