Bringing ipywidgets Support to plotly.py
----------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   Plotly.js is a declarative JavaScript data visualization library built on D3
   and WebGL that supports a wide range of statistical, scientific,
   financial, geographic, and 3-dimensional visualizations. Support for
   creating Plotly.js visualizations from Python is provided by the plotly.py
   library. Version 3 of plotly.py integrates ipywidgets support, providing
   a host of benefits to plotly.py users working in the Jupyter notebook.
   This paper describes the architecture of this new version of plotly.py,
   and presents examples of several of these benefits.

Introduction
------------
The Jupyter Notebook :cite:`Kluyver:2016aa`  has emerged as the dominant
interface for exploratory data analysis and visualization in the Python data
science ecosystem. The ipywidgets library :cite:`ipywidgets` provides a suite
of interactive widgets for use in the Jupyter Notebook, and it serves as a
foundation for library authors to build on to create their own custom widgets.

This paper describes our work to bring ipywidgets support to plotly.py
version 3.  Compared to version 2, plotly.py version 3 brings plotly.py users
working in the Jupyter Notebook a host of benefits. Figures already
displayed in the notebook may now be updated in-place using property
assignment syntax. All properties throughout the entire figure hierarchy are
now discoverable using tab completion and documented with informative
docstrings. Property values are now fully validated by the Python library and
helpful error messages are raised on validation failures. Figure transitions
may now be animated. Numpy arrays are now transferred between the Python and
JavaScript libraries using a binary serialization protocol for improved
performance. Finally, Python callbacks may now be registered for execution
upon zoom, pan, click, hover, and data selection events.

Plotly.js Overview
------------------
Plotly.js is a JavaScript data visualization library based on D3 and WebGL that
supports a wide range of statistical, scientific, financial, geographic, and
3-dimensional visualizations :cite:`plotly`.  The library was initially
developed by Plotly Inc. as a core component of their commercial
visualization offerings. The library was open sourced under the MIT license
in 2015 :cite:`PlotlyOS`, and may now be used fully offline without
requiring any interaction with Plotly Inc's commercial infrastructure.

Data model
++++++++++
.. figure:: figures/data_model_example.pdf
   :scale: 100%

   JSON specification of a basic Plotly.js figure :label:`datamodel`

Plotly figures are fully defined by a declarative JSON specification. Key
components of this specification are shown in the example in Figure
:ref:`datamodel`.

The top-level ``'data'`` property contains an array of the traces present in
the figure.  The object representing each trace contains a ``'type'``
property that identifies the trace type
(e.g. ``'scatter'``, ``'bar'``, ``'violin'``, ``'mesh3d'``, etc.).
The remaining properties are used to configure the trace.  As of version
1.37.1, Plotly.js supports 32 distinct trace types covering many statistical,
scientific, financial, geographic, and 3-dimensional use-cases.

The top-level ``'layout'`` property is an object with properties that specify
characteristics of the figure that are independent of its traces.  These
include the figure's size, axis extents, legend styling, background color, and
many others.

Of particular interest to this work, the Plotly.js library is capable of
exporting a detailed schema corresponding to this JSON specification. The
schema includes the names of all valid properties and information about
their permitted values. This schema is the basis for the Plotly rest API
:cite:`PlotlyRest` and, as discussed below, this schema
enables us to use code-generation to generate a complete Python object
hierarchy corresponding to the JSON structure. Figure :ref:`schemaExample`
presents a excerpt of the plot schema describing the ``'hovermode'``
property of ``layout``.

Next, we provide a brief overview of the relevant portions of the Plotly.js
API that are used by the new widget library.  For more information,
including detailed method signatures, see :cite:`PlotlyJsAPI`.

   :label:`schemaExample`

Commands
++++++++
The following Plotly.js commands are used to create and update figures.

|
| ``Plotly.newPlot``
|     Create a new figure with initial traces and layout
| ``Plotly.restyle``
|     Update one or more properties of one or more pre-existing traces
| ``Plotly.relayout``
|     Update one or more properties of the figure's layout
| ``Plotly.update``
|     Update both trace and layout properties simultaneously
| ``Plotly.addTraces``
|     Add new traces to an existing figure
| ``Plotly.deleteTraces``
|     Delete select traces from an existing figure
| ``Plotly.moveTraces``
|     Move select traces to a new position in the figure's ``data`` array
| ``Plotly.animate``
|     Animate property updates in supported trace types

Events
++++++
The following events are emitted by Plotly.js figures in response to various
kinds of user interaction.

|
| ``plotly_restyle``
|     Emitted when properties of one or more traces are updated. This may
  either be the result of a ``Plotly.restyle`` command or the result of user
  interaction. For example, clicking on a trace in the legend toggles the
  trace's visibility in the figure.  This visibility state is stored in the
  top-level ``visible`` enumeration property on traces.

| ``plotly_relayout``
|     Emitted when properties of the figure's layout are updated. This may
  either be the result of a ``Plotly.relayout`` command or the result of
  user interaction.  For example, panning or zooming a figure's axis updates
  the ``'range'`` sub-property of the top-level ``'xaxis'`` and ``'yaxis'``
  layout properties.

| ``plotly_selected``
|     Emitted when a user completes a selection action using the box select or
  lasso select tools.  The event's data contain the indices of the traces
  from which points were selected and the indices of the selected points
  themselves. Similar events are also emitted when a user clicks
  (``plotly_click``), hovers onto (``plotly_hover``), or hovers off of
  (``plotly_unhover``) points in a trace.

Variables
+++++++++
The current state of a figure is stored in the following four variables.

|
| ``data`` and ``layout``
|     These variables store the trace and layout properties explicitly
  specified by the user.
| ``_fullData`` and ``_fullLayout``
|     These variables store the full collection of trace and layout properties
  that are currently in use, whether specified by the user or selected by
  Plotly.js as defaults.

ipywidgets Overview
-------------------
The ipywidgets library :cite:`ipywidgets` provides a useful collection of
interactive widgets (sliders, check boxes, radio buttons, etc.) for use in
the Jupyter Notebook and in several other contexts :cite:`widgetContexts`.
For the full list of built-in widgets see :cite:`widgetList`.

The integration of graphical widgets into the notebook workflow allows users
to configure ad-hoc control panels to interactively sweep over parameters
using graphical widget controls, rather than by editing code or writing loops
over fixed ranges of values.

The infrastructure behind the built-in ipywidgets is available to library
authors and many custom ipywidgets libraries have been developed
:cite:`CustomWidgets`.  Three notable data visualization examples include
bqplot :cite:`bqplot` for 2-dimensional Grammar of Graphics
:cite:`Wilkinson:2005:GG:1088896` style visualizations, ipyvolume
:cite:`ipyvolume` for 3-dimensional and volumetric visualizations, and
ipyleaflet :cite:`ipyleaflet` for geographic visualization.

The high level architecture, shown in Figure :ref:`ipywidgetsArch`, consists
of four components: The Python model, the JavaScript model, the JavaScript
views, and the Comms interface.  These components are described below.

.. figure:: figures/ipywidgets_arch.pdf
   :scale: 100%

   High level ipywidgets architecture :label:`ipywidgetsArch`

Python Model
++++++++++++
The Python model is a Python class that inherits from the
``ipywidgets.Widget`` superclass and uses the traitlets library
:cite:`traitlets` to declare typed attributes that should be synchronized with
the JavaScript model.

JavaScript Model
++++++++++++++++
The JavaScript model is a JavaScript class that extends the
``@jupyter-widgets/base/WidgetModel`` class and declares a collection of
attributes that match the traitlet declarations in the corresponding Python
model.

When used in the Jupyter Notebook, there is a one-to-one relationship between
the Python and JavaScript models. The JavaScript model is constructed just
after the Python model is constructed, which may be well before the widget is
first displayed.

JavaScript View
+++++++++++++++
The JavaScript view (hereafter referred to as "the view" since there is no
ambiguity) is a JavaScript class that extends the
``@jupyter-widgets/base/WidgetView`` class. When used in the notebook, a
separate view is constructed each time a model is displayed.  Each view has a
reference to one JavaScript model, and multiple views may share the same model.

Comms and Synchronization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Jupyter Comms API provides an abstraction for performing two-way
communication between the front-end and the Python kernel, hiding the
complexity of the web server, ZeroMQ, and WebSocket implementation details.

The synchronization of the Python and JavaScript models is accomplished using
the widget messaging protocol over the Jupyter Comms infrastructure.

A powerful feature of the widget messaging protocol is that it supports the
efficient serialization of nested data structures containing binary buffers.
This capability is used by ipyvolume :cite:`ipyvolume` (and now plotly.py) to
transfer Python numpy arrays into JavaScript TypedArrays without ASCII encoding.

New Plotly.py Figure API
------------------------
In plotly.py version 3, a figure is represented by an instance of the
``plotly.graph_objs.Figure`` class.  A ``Figure`` instance maintains an internal
representation of the figure's JSON specification, and presents a
convenient API for creating and updating this specification.

Code generation is used to create a rich hierarchy of Python classes that
correspond to the object hierarchy specified in the plot schema
described above. Figure :ref:`validationExample` presents an example of
property tab completion (a), a property docstring (b), and a validation
error message (c) for the ``'hovermode'`` property of layout that is defined
by the schema excerpt in Figure :ref:`schemaExample`.

   :figclass: w
   :scale: 90%
   :align: center

   Tab completion, documentation, and validation of ``hovermode`` property
   :label:`validationExample`

Select components of the new API are described below, and an example of their
use is presented in Figure :ref:`figureApiExample`.

Construction
++++++++++++
If the full specification of the desired figure is known in advance, the
specification may be passed directly to the ``Figure`` constructor as a Python
``dict``.  This construction process will trigger the validation of all
properties and nested properties according to the plot schema.  Figure
:ref:`figureApiExample` (a) presents an example of constructing a ``Figure``
with a single ``bar`` trace.

Property Assignment
+++++++++++++++++++
A ``Figure``'s properties may be configured iteratively after construction
using property assignment. Figure :ref:`figureApiExample` (b) presents an
example of setting the x-axis range to ``[-1, 3]`` using property assignment.

Add Traces
++++++++++
A new trace may be added to an existing ``Figure`` using the ``add_{trace}``
method that corresponds to the desired trace type.  Figure
:ref:`figureApiExample` (c) presents an example of adding a new ``scatter``
trace to a ``Figure`` instance using the ``add_scatter`` method.

Batch Update
++++++++++++
Multiple properties may be updated simultaneously using a
``Figure.batch_update()`` context manager.  In this case, all property
assignments specified inside the ``batch_update`` context will be executed
simultaneously when the context exits. Figure :ref:`figureApiExample` (d)
presents an example of assigning four properties across two traces and the
layout inside a ``batch_update`` context.

Reorder Traces
++++++++++++++
The ordering of traces in the ``Figure``'s ``data`` list determines the order
in which the traces are displayed in the legend, and the colors
that are chosen for traces by default.  The trace order can be updated by
assigning to the ``data`` property a list that contains a permutation of
the figure's current traces. Figure :ref:`figureApiExample` (e) presents an
example of swapping the order of the ``bar`` and ``scatter`` traces.

Delete Traces
+++++++++++++
Traces may be deleted by omitting them from the list of traces that is
assigned to a ``Figure``'s ``data`` property. Figure
:ref:`figureApiExample` (f) presents an example of deleting the ``bar`` trace
by assigning a list that contains only the ``scatter`` trace.

Batch Animate
+++++++++++++
Multiple properties may be updated simultaneously using a
``Figure.batch_animate()`` context manager.  When applied to a ``Figure``
instance this works just like the ``batch_update`` context manager.
However, when applied to a ``FigureWidget`` instance (described below) the
Plotly.js library will attempt to smoothly animate the transition to the new
property values. Figure :ref:`figureApiExample` (g) presents an example of
animating a change in the ``Figure``'s x-axis and y-axis range extents.

New Plotly.py ipywidgets Implementation
---------------------------------------
The entry point for the new ipywidgets support is the
``plotly.graph_objs.FigureWidget`` class. ``FigureWidget`` is a subclass of
``Figure`` and, as such, inherits all of the ``Figure`` characteristics
described in the previous section.

Implementing a custom ipywidgets library for Plotly.js presents some
architectural challenges. Plotly.js does not expose a model-view separation,
each figure stores its own data locally in the figure's root DOM element.
This means that each ipywidgets JavaScript view will necessarily be an
independent Plotly.js figure instance with its own data. As such, we must
take responsibility for keeping the JavaScript model in sync with the state
of the Plotly.js figures in each view.

An additional performance-based architectural restriction is that as few
properties as possible should be transferred between the Python and JavaScript
models. This restriction eliminates solutions that require serialization of the
entire plot specification when only a subset of the properties are modified.

The following sections describe our solution to these challenges.

Python to JavaScript Synchronization
------------------------------------
Python to JavaScript synchronization is achieved by translating Python
``FigureWidget`` mutation operations into Plotly.js API commands. These
commands, and their associated data, are transferred to the JavaScript model
and views using the widget messaging protocol, over the Jupyter Comms
infrastructure, as described above.  The views are updated by executing the
specified Plotly.js command, and the JavaScript model is updated manually in
a consistent fashion.

   Plotly.js commands corresponding to operations in Figure
   :ref:`figureApiExample` if the ``Figure`` class is replaced by
   ``FigureWidget`` :label:`exampleCommands`

Construction
++++++++++++
Construction operations are translated into ``Plotly.newPlot`` commands.
Figure :ref:`exampleCommands` (a) presents an example of the ``newPlot``
command that results from the construction operation in Figure
:ref:`figureApiExample` (a) if the ``Figure`` class is replaced by
``FigureWidget``.

Property Assignment
+++++++++++++++++++
Trace property assignments are translated into ``Plotly.restyle`` commands,
and layout property assignments are translated into ``Plotly.relayout``
commands. Figure :ref:`exampleCommands` (b) presents an example of the
``relayout`` command that results from the property assignment operation in
Figure :ref:`figureApiExample` (b).

Add Traces
++++++++++
Add trace operations are translated into ``Plotly.addTraces`` commands.
Figure :ref:`exampleCommands` (c) presents an example of the ``addTraces``
command that results from the ``add_scatter`` operation in
:ref:`figureApiExample` (c).

Batch Update
++++++++++++
Batch update operations are translated in to ``Plotly.update`` commands.
Figure :ref:`exampleCommands` (d) presents an example of the ``update``
command that results from the ``batch_update`` operation in
:ref:`figureApiExample` (d).

Reorder Traces
++++++++++++++
Trace reordering operations are translated into ``Plotly.moveTraces`` commands.
Figure :ref:`exampleCommands` (e) presents an example of the ``moveTraces``
command that results from the ``data`` assignment operation in
:ref:`figureApiExample` (e).

Delete Traces
+++++++++++++
Trace deletion operations are translated into ``Plotly.deleteTraces`` commands.
Figure :ref:`exampleCommands` (f) presents an example of the ``deleteTraces``
command that results from the ``data`` assignment operation in
:ref:`figureApiExample` (f).

Batch Animate
+++++++++++++
Batch animate operations are translated into ``Plotly.animate`` commands.
Figure :ref:`exampleCommands` (g) presents an example of the ``animate``
command that results from the ``batch_animate`` operation in
:ref:`figureApiExample` (g).

JavaScript to Python Synchronization
------------------------------------
JavaScript to Python synchronization is required when a user interacts with a
Plotly.js figure in a view in such a way that the figure's internal
specification is modified. For example, the action of zooming or panning a
figure causes a modification to the figure's x-axis and y-axis range properties.

To maintain consistency, views listen for ``plotly_restyle`` and
``plotly_relayout`` events and forward these commands to the Python model.
The Python model then applies the command to itself and forwards the command
to the Java Script model and any additional views.

Property change callbacks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Python functions may be registered for execution when particular trace
or layout properties are modified by using the ``on_change`` method. This
method is available on all compound objects in the figure hierarchy.

Figure :ref:`zoomExample` presents an example of constructing and displaying a
``FigureWidget`` instance (a) and then registering the ``handle_zoom`` function
for execution when the ``range`` sub-property of either the ``xaxis`` or the
``yaxis`` properties is changed (b).

Next, the zoom tool is used to select a region that extends from 0 to 1 on the
x-axis and from 1.5 to 2.5 on the y-axis (c).  The Plotly.js figure that
executes the zoom action emits a ``plotly_relayout`` event (d) which the view
forwards to the Python model (e).  The Python model applies the update to
itself and then sends a ``relayout`` message to the JavaScript model (f) and
any additional JavaScript views (g).  Finally, the Python model executes any
callback functions registered on the ``range`` sub-property of ``xaxis`` or
``yaxis`` (h).

.. figure:: figures/zoom_example.pdf
   :scale: 100%

   Zoom property change callback example :label:`zoomExample`

Point interaction callbacks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
As discussed above, a Plotly.js figure emits events when a user
interacts with a trace by clicking (``plotly_click``),
hovering onto (``plotly_hover``), hovering off of (``plotly_unhover``), or
selecting (``plotly_selected``) points. Trace objects in plotly.py now
support the registration of Python callbacks to be executed when these events
occur.

Figure :ref:`selectionExample` presents an example of constructing and
displaying a  ``FigureWidget`` instance with a ``scattergl`` trace containing
100,000 normally distributed points (a).  The ``scattergl`` trace is a WebGL
optimized version of the SVG-based ``scatter`` trace used in previous examples.

Trace markers are configured to be colored based on a color scale and a
numeric vector.  The ``cmin`` and ``cmax`` properties specify that
``color`` values of 0 should be mapped to the bottom of the color scale
(light gray for the default scale) and values of 1 should be mapped to the
top of the color scale (dark red for the default scale).  The color vector is
initialized to all zeros so all points are initially light gray in color.

Next, the ``brush`` function is defined and then registered with the trace for
execution when a selection event occurs using the trace's ``on_selection``
method (b). The first argument to the ``brush`` function is the trace that
was selected (the ``scattergl`` trace in this case) and the second argument
is a list of the indices of the points that were selected.

The box select tool is used to select a rectangular region of points (c). This
triggers the execution of the ``brush`` function. The ``brush`` function
updates the marker's ``color`` property to be an array where the
elements corresponding to selected points have a value of 1 and all other
elements have a value of 0. Due to the marker color configuration
described above, this causes the selected points to be displayed in dark red.

It is significant to note that even though there are 100,000 points,
the time to display the initial figure and the time to update point
colors based on a new selection are each less than one second. This latency
level is enabled by the efficient transfer of numpy arrays to the JavaScript
front-end as binary buffers over the Jupyter Comms interface, and by the
WebGL accelerated implementation of the ``scattergl`` trace.

   Data selection and brushing example :label:`selectionExample`

Default Properties
++++++++++++++++++
Plotly.js provides a flexible range of configuration options to control
the appearance of a figure's traces and layout, and it will attempt to
compute reasonable defaults for properties not specified by the user.

To improve the experience of interactively refining a figure's appearance,
it is very helpful to provide the user with the default values of unspecified
properties. For example, if a user would like to specify a ``scatter`` trace
marker size that is slightly larger than the default, it is very helpful for
the user to know that the default value is 6.

Default property information for traces may be determined by comparing the
``data`` and ``_fullData`` variables of the Plotly.js figure. Any property
value specified in ``_fullData`` that is not specified in ``data`` is
considered a default property value. Similarly, the ``layout`` and
``_fullLayout`` variables may be used to determine default values for layout
properties.

Default properties are transferred from a view to the Python model upon any
change to the Plotly.js figure. These default property values are then returned
by the Python model during property access when no user specified value is
available.

Conclusion
----------
The integration of plotly.py version 3 with the ipywidgets library brings a
wide range of benefits to plotly.py users working in the Jupyter Notebook.
Figure properties are now easily discoverable through the use of tab
completion, and they are understandable thanks to the presence of detailed
docstrings. This greatly reduces the need for users to interrupt their
analysis workflow to consult external documentation resources.

All of these properties may be updated using property assignment syntax and
the updates are immediately applied to all of the displayed views of the
figure. This allows users to begin the visualization process with simple
figures, and then iteratively refine them.

These iterative updates transfer as few properties from Python to JavaScript
as possible, and numpy arrays are transferred as binary buffers without ASCII
encoding.  Combined with the Plotly.js library's performance optimized WebGL
trace types, this allows users to create and interactively explore
visualizations of data sets with hundreds of thousands of points.

Plotly figures may now be arranged in custom layouts with other ipywidgets,
and Python functions may now be registered for execution in response to figure
interactions including pan, zoom, click, hover, and selection.  These
features allow users to create rich dashboards right in the notebook.

In total, the integration of ipywidgets support in plotly.py version 3
dramatically enhances the interactive data visualization experience for
plotly.py users working in the Jupyter Notebook, and we are excited to see what
the SciPy community will build with these new tools.
