  Building environmental simulation workflows is typically a slow process
  involving multiple proprietary desktop tools that do not interoperate well. In
  this work, we demonstrate building flexible, lightweight workflows entirely in
  Jupyter notebooks. We demonstrate these capabilities through examples in
  hydrology and hydrodynamics using the AdH (Adaptive Hydraulics) and GSSHA
  (Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis) simulators. The goal of this
  work is to provide a set of tools that work well together and with the
  existing scientific python ecosystem, that can be used in browser based
  environments and that can easily be reconfigured and repurposed as needed to
  rapidly solve specific emerging issues such as hurricanes or dam failures.


  As part of this work, extensive improvements were made to several
  general-purpose open source packages, including support for annotating and
  editing plots and maps in Bokeh and HoloViews, rendering large triangular
  meshes and regridding large raster data in HoloViews, GeoViews, and
  Datashader, and widget libraries for Param. In addition, two new open source
  projects are being released, one for triangular mesh generation (Filigree) and
  one for environmental data access ([Quest](https://quest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
