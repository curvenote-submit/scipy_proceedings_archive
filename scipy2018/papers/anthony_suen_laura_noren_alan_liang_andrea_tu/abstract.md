title: Equity, Scalability, and Sustainability of Data Science Infrastructure
description: We seek to understand the current state of equity, scalability, and
  sustainability of data science education infrastructure in both the U.S. and
  Canada. Our analysis of the technological, funding, and organizational
  structure of four types of institutions shows an increasing divergence in the
  ability of universities across the United States to provide students with
  accessible data science education infrastructure, primarily JupyterHub.
abstract: We seek to understand the current state of equity, scalability, and
  sustainability of data science education infrastructure in both the U.S. and
  Canada. Our analysis of the technological, funding, and organizational
  structure of four types of institutions shows an increasing divergence in the
  ability of universities across the United States to provide students with
  accessible data science education infrastructure, primarily JupyterHub. We
  observe that generally liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and other
  institutions with limited IT staff and experience have greater difficulty
  setting up and maintaining JupyterHub, compared to well-funded private
  institutions or large public research universities with a deep technical bench
  of IT staff. However, by leveraging existing public-private partnerships and
  the experience of Canadaâ€™s national JupyterHub (Syzygy), the U.S. has an
  opportunity to provide a wider range of institutions and students access to
  JupyterHub.
