title: 'Design and Implementation of pyPRISM: A Polymer Liquid-State Theory Framework'
description: In this work, we describe the code structure, implementation, and
  usage of a Python-based, open-source framework, pyPRISM, for conducting
  polymer liquid-state theory calculations. Polymer Reference Interaction Site
  Model (PRISM) theory describes the equilibrium spatial-correlations,
  thermodynamics, and structure of liquid-like polymer systems and
  macromolecular materials.
abstract: In this work, we describe the code structure, implementation, and
  usage of a Python-based, open-source framework, `pyPRISM`, for conducting
  polymer liquid-state theory calculations. Polymer Reference Interaction Site
  Model (PRISM) theory describes the equilibrium spatial-correlations,
  thermodynamics, and structure of liquid-like polymer systems and
  macromolecular materials. `pyPRISM` provides data structures, functions, and
  classes that streamline predictive PRISM calculations and can be extended for
  other tasks such as the coarse-graining of atomistic simulation force-fields
  or the modeling of experimental scattering data. The goal of providing this
  framework is to reduce the barrier to correctly and appropriately using PRISM
  theory and to provide a platform for rapid calculations of the structure and
  thermodynamics of polymeric fluids and polymer nanocomposites.
