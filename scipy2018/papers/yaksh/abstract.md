abstract: Yaksh is a free and open-source online evaluation platform. At its
  core, Yaksh focuses on problem-based learning and lets teachers create
  practice exercises and quizzes which are evaluated in real-time. A large array
  of question types like multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, assignment upload,
  and assertion or standard I/O based programming questions are available. Yaksh
  supports Python, C, C++, Java, Bash, and Scilab programming languages. In
  addition, Yaksh allows teachers to create full-blown courses with video and/or
  markdown text-based lessons. Yaksh is designed to be secure, easily
  deployable, and can scale-up to 500+ users simultaneously.
