title: 'Sparse: A more modern sparse array library'
description: This paper is about sparse multi-dimensional arrays in Python. We
  discuss their applications, layouts, and current implementations in the SciPy
  ecosystem along with strengths and weaknesses. We then introduce a new package
  for sparse arrays that builds on the legacy of the scipy.
abstract: This paper is about sparse multi-dimensional arrays in Python. We
  discuss their applications, layouts, and current implementations in the SciPy
  ecosystem along with strengths and weaknesses. We then introduce a new package
  for sparse arrays that builds on the legacy of the `scipy.sparse`
  implementation, but supports more modern interfaces, dimensions greater than
  two, and improved integration with newer array packages, like XArray and Dask.
  We end with performance benchmarks and notes on future work. Additionally,
  this work provides a concrete implementation of the recent NumPy array
  protocols to build generic array interfaces for improved interoperability, and
  so may be useful for broader community discussion.
