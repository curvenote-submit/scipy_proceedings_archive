    abstract = "The past decade has witnessed explosive growth in the
        development of nanoparticle-based therapies for the treatment
        of neurological disorders and diseases. The systemic delivery
        of therapeutic carriers to the central nervous system (CNS) is
        hindered by both the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the porous
        and electrostatically charged brain extracellular matrix (ECM),
        which acts as a steric and adhesive barrier. Therapeutic
        delivery to the brain is influenced by changes in the brain
        microenvironment, which can occur as a function of physiology,
        biology, pathology, and developmental age. Brain-penetrating
        nanoparticles (BPNs) are an optimal platform not only for
        therapeutic delivery to the brain, but also for evaluating
        changes in the brain microenvironment. BPNs possess both the
        capability to readily move within their local environment to
        survey their surroundings and the ability to reach the diffuse
        disease cells often associated with CNS disorders. To achieve
        effective delivery of BPNs to specific locations within the
        brain requires careful control over the nanoparticle's transport
        properties. Here, we describe the process of conjugating a
        dense layer of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to the surface of

    abstract = "We present TrackMate, an open source Fiji plugin for the
        automated, semi-automated, and manual tracking of
        single-particles. It offers a versatile and modular solution
        that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and
        intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and
        adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over
        time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image
        variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis
        tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The
        utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability
        to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems.
        TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily
        write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or
        analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This
        evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to
        quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing
        TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo
        user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting
        tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in
        the context of three different biological problems. First,
        we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess
        how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early
        development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates
        the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second,
        we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-kappaB essential
        modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the
        cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts
        in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse
        motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for
        quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis
        in plant cells.",

        of diffusion distributions inindividual voxels; fiber
        tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysisand
        visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations
        forall the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform
        programming interface.We have implemented classical signal
        reconstruction techniques, such as thediffusion tensor model
        and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition,cutting
        edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such
        asconstrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum
        imaging withdeconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic
        tracking and originalmethods for tractography clustering.
        Many additional utility functions areprovided to calculate

        contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and
        opendiscussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy

              Connectome Project (HCP). The 'HCP-style' paradigm has seven core

              (ii) acquire data at high spatial and temporal resolution; (iii)
              preprocess data to minimize distortions, blurring and temporal
              artifacts; (iv) represent data using the natural geometry of
              cortical and subcortical structures; (v) accurately align
              corresponding brain areas across subjects and studies; (vi)
              analyze data using neurobiologically accurate brain
              parcellations; and (vii) share published data via user-friendly
              databases. We illustrate the HCP-style paradigm using existing
              HCP data sets and provide guidance for future research.
