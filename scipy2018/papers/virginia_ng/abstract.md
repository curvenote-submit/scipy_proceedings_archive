  Deep learning techniques have greatly advanced the performance of the already
  rapidly developing field of computer vision, which powers a variety of
  emerging technologies — from facial recognition to augmented reality to
  self-driving cars. The remote sensing and mapping communities are particularly
  interested in extracting, understanding and mapping physical elements in the
  landscape. These mappable physical elements are called features, and can
  include both natural and synthetic objects of any scale, complexity and
  character. Points or polygons representing sidewalks, glaciers, playgrounds,
  entire cities, and bicycles are all examples of features. In this paper we
  present a method to develop deep learning tools and pipelines that generate
  features from aerial and satellite imagery at large scale. Practical
  applications include object detection, semantic segmentation and automatic
  mapping of general-interest features such as turn lane markings on roads,
  parking lots, roads, water, building footprints.


  We give an overview of our data preparation process, in which data from the
  Mapbox Satellite layer, a global imagery collection, is annotated with labels
  created from OpenStreetMap data using minimal manual effort. We then discuss
  the implementation of various state-of-the-art detection and semantic
  segmentation systems such as the improved version of You Only Look Once
  (YOLOv2), modified U-Net, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet), as well as
  specific adaptations for the aerial and satellite imagery domain. We conclude
  by discussing our ongoing efforts in improving our models and expanding their
  applicability across classes of features, geographical regions, and relatively
  novel data sources such as street-level and drone imagery.
