title: A Bayesianâ€™s journey to a better research workflow
description: This work began when the two authors met at a software development
  meeting. Konstantinos was building Bayesian models in his research and wanted
  to learn how to better manage his research process. Marianne was working on
  data analysis workflows in industry and wanted to learn more about Bayesian
  statistics.
abstract: This work began when the two authors met at a software development
  meeting. Konstantinos was building Bayesian models in his research and wanted
  to learn how to better manage his research process. Marianne was working on
  data analysis workflows in industry and wanted to learn more about Bayesian
  statistics. In this paper, the authors present a Bayesian scientific research
  workflow for statistical analysis. Drawing on a case study in clinical trials,
  they demonstrate lessons that other scientists, not necessarily Bayesian,
  could find useful in their own work. Notably, they can be used to improve
  productivity and reproducibility in any computational research project.
