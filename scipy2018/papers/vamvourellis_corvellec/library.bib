abstract = {Bayesian data analysis is about more than just computing a posterior
distribution, and Bayesian visualization is about more than trace plots of
Markov chains. Practical Bayesian data analysis, like all data analysis, is an
iterative process of model building, inference, model checking and evaluation,
and model expansion. Visualization is helpful in each of these stages of the
Bayesian workflow and it is indispensable when drawing inferences from the types
of modern, high-dimensional models that are used by applied researchers.},

abstract = {"A CRC title." "Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with
Examples in R and Stan builds readers' knowledge of and confidence in
statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today's
model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step
calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach
ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices
and interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents generalized
linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple
logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers
from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses
measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and
network autocorrelation." --Publisher's website.

@article{Talhouk2012a,
abstract = {We propose a Bayesian approach for inference in the multivariate
probit model, taking into account the association structure between binary
observations. We model the association through the correlation matrix of the
latent Gaussian variables. Conditional independence is imposed by setting some
off-diagonal elements of the inverse correlation matrix to zero and this
sparsity structure is modeled using a decomposable graphical model. We propose
an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm relying on a parameter expansion
scheme to sample from the resulting posterior distribution. This algorithm
updates the correlation matrix within a simple Gibbs sampling framework and
allows us to infer the correlation structure from the data, generalizing methods
used for inference in decomposable Gaussian graphical models to multivariate
binary observations. We demonstrate the performance of this model and of the
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm on simulated and real datasets. This article
has online supplementary ...},

abstract = {Background Rosiglitazone is widely used to treat patients with type
2 diabetes mellitus, but its effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
has not been determined. Methods We conducted searches of the published
literature, the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration, and a
clinical-trials registry maintained by the drug manufacturer (GlaxoSmithKline).
Criteria for inclusion in our meta-analysis included a study duration of more
than 24 weeks, the use of a randomized control group not receiving
rosiglitazone, and the availability of outcome data for myocardial infarction
and death from cardiovascular causes. Of 116 potentially relevant studies, 42
trials met the inclusion criteria. We tabulated all occurrences of myocardial
infarction and death from cardiovascular causes. Results Data were combined by
means of a fixed-effects model. In the 42 trials, the mean age of the subjects
was approximately 56 years, and the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level was
approximately 8.2 ...},
