abstract: Computational research requires versatile data and workflow management
  tools that can easily adapt to the highly dynamic requirements of scientific
  investigations. Many existing tools require strict adherence to a particular
  usage pattern, so researchers often use less robust ad hoc solutions that they
  find easier to adopt. The resulting data fragmentation and methodological
  incompatibilities significantly impede research. Our talk showcases signac, an
  open-source Python framework that offers highly modular and scalable solutions
  for this problem. Named for the Pointillist painter Paul Signac, the
  framework's powerful workflow management tools enable users to construct and
  automate workflows that transition seamlessly from laptops to HPC clusters.
  Crucially, the underlying data model is completely independent of the
  workflow. The flexible, serverless, and schema-free signac database can be
  introduced into other workflows with essentially no overhead and no recourse
  to the signac workflow model. Additionally, the data model's simplicity makes
  it easy to parse the underlying data without using signac at all. This
  modularity and simplicity eliminates significant barriers for consistent data
  management across projects, facilitating improved provenance management and
  data sharing with minimal overhead.
