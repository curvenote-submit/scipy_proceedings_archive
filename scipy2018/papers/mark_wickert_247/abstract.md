title: Exploring the Extended Kalman Filter for GPS Positioning Using Simulated
  User and Satellite Track Data
description: This paper describes a Python computational tool for exploring the
  use of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for position estimation using the
  Global Positioning System (GPS) pseudorange measurements. The development was
  motivated by the need for an example generator in a training class on Kalman
  filtering, with emphasis on GPS.
abstract: This paper describes a Python computational tool for exploring the use
  of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for position estimation using the Global
  Positioning System (GPS) pseudorange measurements. The development was
  motivated by the need for an example generator in a training class on Kalman
  filtering, with emphasis on GPS. In operation of the simulation framework both
  user and satellite trajectories are played through the simulation. The User
  trajectory is input in local east-north-up (ENU) coordinates and satellites
  tracks, specified by the C/A code PRN number, are propagated using the Python
  package SGP4 using two-line element (TLE) data available from Celestrak.
