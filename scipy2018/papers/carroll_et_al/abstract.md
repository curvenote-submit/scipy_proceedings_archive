title: "The Econ-ARK and HARK: Open Source Tools for Computational Economics"
description: The Economics Algorithmic Repository and toolKit (Econ-ARK) aims to
  become a focal resource for computational economics. Its first ‘framework,’
  the Heterogeneous Agent Resources and Toolkit (HARK), provides a modern,
  robust, transparent set of tools to solve a class of macroeconomic models
  whose usefulness has become increasingly apparent both for economic policy and
  for research purposes, but whose adoption has been limited because the
  existing literature derives from idiosyncratic, hand-crafted, and often
  impenetrable legacy code.

  analysis of the transmission of beliefs through agents' social networks) will
  draw heavily on key elements of the existing HARK framework, including the
  API, the structure, and documentation standards.
