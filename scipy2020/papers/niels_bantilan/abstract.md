title: "pandera: Statistical Data Validation of Pandas Dataframes"
description: pandas is an essential tool in the data scientist’s toolkit for
  modern data engineering, analysis, and modeling in the Python ecosystem.
  However, dataframes can often be difficult to reason about in terms of their
  data types and statistical properties as data is reshaped from its raw form to
  one that’s ready for analysis.
abstract: pandas is an essential tool in the data scientist’s toolkit for modern
  data engineering, analysis, and modeling in the Python ecosystem. However,
  dataframes can often be difficult to reason about in terms of their data types
  and statistical properties as data is reshaped from its raw form to one that’s
  ready for analysis. Here, I introduce pandera, an open source package that
  provides a flexible and expressive data validation API designed to make it
  easy for data wranglers to define dataframe schemas. These schemas execute
  logical and statistical assertions at runtime so that analysts can spend less
  time worrying about the correctness of their dataframes and more time
  obtaining insights and training models.
