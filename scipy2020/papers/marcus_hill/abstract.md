title: "Spectral Analysis of Mitochondrial Dynamics: A Graph-Theoretic Approach
  to Understanding Subcellular Pathology"
description: Perturbations of organellar structures within a cell are useful
  indicators of the cell’s response to viral or bacterial invaders. Of the
  various organelles, mitochondria are meaningful to model because they show
  distinct migration patterns in the presence of potentially fatal infections,
  such as tuberculosis.
abstract: Perturbations of organellar structures within a cell are useful
  indicators of the cell’s response to viral or bacterial invaders. Of the
  various organelles, mitochondria are meaningful to model because they show
  distinct migration patterns in the presence of potentially fatal infections,
  such as tuberculosis. Properly modeling and assessing mitochondria could
  provide new information about infections that can be leveraged to develop
  tests, treatments, and vaccines. Traditionally, mitochondrial structures have
  been assessed via manual inspection of fluorescent microscopy imagery.
  However, manual microscopy studies are labor-intensive and fail to provide a
  high-throughput for screenings. Thus, demonstrating the need for techniques
  that are more automated and utilize quantitative metrics for analysis. Yet,
  modeling mitochondria is no trivial task; mitochondria are amorphous,
  spatially diffuse structures that render traditional shape-based, parametric
  modeling techniques ineffective. We address the modeling task by using OrNet
  (Organellar Networks), a Python framework that utilizes probabilistic,
  graph-theoretic techniques to cast mitochondrial dynamics in the mold of
  dynamic social networks. We propose quantitative temporal and spatial anomaly
  detection techniques that leverage the graph connectivity information of the
  social networks to reveal time points of anomalous behavior and spatial
  regions where organellar structures undergo significant morphological changes
  related to a relevant change in environment or stimulus. We demonstrate the
  advantages of these techniques with the results of exhaustive graph-theoretic
  analyses over time in three different mitochondrial conditions. This
  methodology provides the quantification, visualization, and analysis
  techniques necessary for rigorous spatiotemporal modeling of diffuse
  organelles.
