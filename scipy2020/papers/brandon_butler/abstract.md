title: HOOMD-blue version 3.0 A Modern, Extensible, Flexible, Object-Oriented
  API for Molecular Simulations
description: HOOMD-blue is a library for running molecular dynamics and hard
  particle Monte Carlo simulations that uses pybind11 to provide a Python
  interface to fast C++ internals. The package is designed to scale from a
  single CPU core to thousands of NVIDIA or AMD GPUs.
abstract: HOOMD-blue is a library for running molecular dynamics and hard
  particle Monte Carlo simulations that uses pybind11 to provide a Python
  interface to fast C++ internals. The package is designed to scale from a
  single CPU core to thousands of NVIDIA or AMD GPUs. In developing HOOMD-blue
  version 3.0, we significantly improve the application protocol interface (API)
  by making it more flexible, extensible, and Pythonic. We have also striven to
  provide simpler and more performant entry points to the internal C++ classes
  and data structures. With these updates, we show how HOOMD-blue users will be
  able to write completely custom Python classes which integrate directly into
  the simulation run loop and analyze previously inaccessible data. Throughout
  this paper, we focus on how these goals have been achieved and explain design
  decisions through examples of the newly developed API.
