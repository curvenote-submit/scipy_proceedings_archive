title: "Software Engineering as Research Method: Aligning Roles in Econ-ARK"
description: While general purpose scientific software has enjoyed great success

  become well-established in many disciplines where it has potential.
abstract: While general purpose scientific software has enjoyed great success in
  industry and academia, domain specific scientific software has not yet become
  well-established in many disciplines where it has potential. Based on a survey
  of the literature as well as the authors' experiences contributing to
  Econ-ARK, a structural modeling toolkit for Economics, we argue that this is
  due to the well-documented skills gap that prevents researchers, publishers,
  and professors from making the most of the opportunities afforded by
  scientific software. When researchers professionalize their code, it enables
  more cumulative progress in research and facilitates technology transfer. When
  publishers release interactive computational artifacts, it enables
  constructionist learning of the material. When students are trained in
  software engineering, they can participate fully in the reproduction of their
  scientific field. This is especially the case for fields where scientific
  knowledge is represented in software code, as in the case of Economics. The
  skills gap will not be closed until software engineering is considered a core
  skill for the discipline. Software engineering should be reconceived as a
  research method.
