  A framework for combining physics-based and data-driven models to improve well
  construction is presented in this study. Additionally, the proposed approach
  provides a more robust and accurate model that mitigates the disadvantages of
  using purely physics-based or data-driven models. This approach can provide
  improved model-based control of drilling rig actuators (assocated with mud
  pumps, pipe handling systems, etc.).


  Traditionally, models based on physics including Hagen-Poiseuille flow,
  Hookeâ€™s law, etc. are used during well construction. Physics-based models
  facilitate the design of the drilling plan and are vital to safely and
  successfully drilling wellbores. There are two major shortcomings, however, to
  using purely physics-based models. First, the models can be inaccurate if the
  physical dynamics are not fully accounted for. Accurately capturing data to
  describe these processes can be involved, complex or prohibitively expensive.
  Second, these models must be maintained and calibrated during drilling, which
  requires a large amount of operator input and is liable to human error. On the
  other hand, pure data-driven approaches are unable to represent underlying
  mechanism dynamics and often struggle to properly capture causal
  relationships. It is shown in this work combining physics and data-driven
  modeling provides a more robust framework for well planning and execution.


  Machine learning techniques are combined with physics-based models via a
  rule-based stochastic hidden Markov model, using the modeling of frictional
  pressure losses during fluid circulation in the well as an example. Gaussian
  processes, neural networks and a deep learning model are trained and executed
  together with a physics model that is directly derived using first principles.


  The results show that combination modeling can accurately predict the pressure
  losses even outperforming the physics-based and purely data-driven modeling.
  The proposed approach has a good potential to allow safer, optimized well
  construction operations.
