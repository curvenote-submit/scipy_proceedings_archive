With the momentum gaining for the grid computing systems, the issue of deploying support for integrated scheduling and fault-tolerant approaches becomes paramount importance. Unfortunately, fault-tolerance has not been factored into the design of most existing grid scheduling strategies. To this end, we propose a fault-tolerant scheduling policy that loosely couples job scheduling with job replication scheme such that jobs are efficiently and reliably executed. Performance evaluation of the proposed fault-tolerant scheduler against a nonfault-tolerant scheduling policy is presented and shown that the proposed policy performs reasonably in the presence of various types of failures.},

In this paper, we present a programmable approach that leverages software-defined techniques to create a dynamic space-time infrastructure service composition. We propose the use of Constraint Programming as a formal language to allow users, applications, and service providers to define the desired state of the execution environment. The resulting distributed software-defined environment continually adapts to meet objectives/constraints set by the users, applications, and/or resource providers. We present the design and prototype implementation of such distributed software-defined environment. We use a cancer informatics workflow to demonstrate the operation of our framework using resources from five different cloud providers, which are aggregated on-demand based on dynamic user and resource provider constraints.},

However, achieving this vision requires new models that can support dynamic (and opportunistic) compositions of infrastructure services, which can adapt to evolving application needs and the state of resources. In this article, we present a programmable dynamic infrastructure service composition approach that uses software-defined environment concepts to control the composition process. The resulting software-defined infrastructure service composition adapts to meet objectives and constraints set by the users, applications, and/or resource providers. We present and compare two different approaches for programming resources and controlling the service composition, one that is based on a rule engine and another that leverages a constraint programming model for resource description. We present the design and prototype implementation of such software-defined service composition and demonstrate its operation through a use case where multiple views of heterogeneous, geographically distributed services are aggregated on demand based on user and resource provider specifications. The resulting compositions are used to run different bioinformatics workloads, which are encapsulated inside Docker containers. Each view independently adapts to various constraints and events that are imposed on the system while minimizing the workload completion time.},

Furthermore, the involvement of increasingly large number of scientific instruments such as sensors and machines makes the scientific data management even more challenging since the data generated from such type of instruments are highly complex. To reduce the amount of complexities in conducting scientific experiments as much as possible, an integrated framework that transparently implements the conceptual separation between both the dimensions is direly needed.

Task execution failure is no longer accidental but a common characteristic of cloud computing environment. In recent times, a number of intelligent scheduling techniques have been used to address task scheduling issues in cloud without much attention to fault tolerance. In this research article, we proposed a dynamic clustering league championship algorithm (DCLCA) scheduling technique for fault tolerance awareness to address cloud task execution which would reflect on the current available resources and reduce the untimely failure of autonomous tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed technique produces remarkable fault reduction in task failure as measured in terms of failure rate. It also shows that the DCLCA outperformed the MTCT, MAXMIN, ant colony optimization and genetic algorithm-based NSGA-II by producing lower makespan with improvement of 57.8, 53.6, 24.3 and 13.4 \% in the first scenario and 60.0, 38.9, 31.5 and 31.2 \% in the second scenario, respectively. Considering the experimental results, DCLCA provides better quality fault tolerance aware scheduling that will help to improve the overall performance of the cloud environment.},

A player is free to schedule his own services at any time; however, each of these services only begins to accrue reward for the player when all predecessor services, which may or may not be controlled by the same player, have been activated. This model, where players have interdependent services, is motivated by the problems faced in planning and coordinating large-scale infrastructures, e.g., restoring electricity and gas to residents after a natural disaster or providing medical care in a crisis when different agencies are responsible for the delivery of staff, equipment, and medicine. We undertake a game-theoretic analysis of this setting and in particular consider the issues of welfare maximization, computing best responses, Nash dynamics, and existence and computation of Nash equilibria.},

One of the most challenging problems in Clouds is workflow scheduling, i.e., the problem of satisfying the QoS requirements of the user as well as minimizing the cost of workflow execution. We have previously designed and analyzed a two-phase scheduling algorithm for utility Grids, called Partial Critical Paths (PCP), which aims to minimize the cost of workflow execution while meeting a user-defined deadline. However, we believe Clouds are different from utility Grids in three ways: on-demand resource provisioning, homogeneous networks, and the pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this paper, we adapt the PCP algorithm for the Cloud environment and propose two workflow scheduling algorithms: a one-phase algorithm which is called IaaS Cloud Partial Critical Paths (IC-PCP), and a two-phase algorithm which is called IaaS Cloud Partial Critical Paths with Deadline Distribution (IC-PCPD2). Both algorithms have a polynomial time complexity which make them suitable options for scheduling large workflows.

  abstract = {The advent of Cloud computing as a new model of service provisioning in distributed systems encourages researchers to investigate its benefits and drawbacks on executing scientific applications such as workflows. One of the most challenging problems in Clouds is workflow scheduling, i.e., the problem of satisfying the QoS requirements of the user as well as minimizing the cost of workflow execution. We have previously designed and analyzed a two-phase scheduling algorithm for utility Grids, called Partial Critical Paths (PCP), which aims to minimize the cost of workflow execution while meeting a user-defined deadline.

  abstract = {As cloud computing technologies finalize their transformation into the standard technologies for businesses of all sizes, they face more scrutiny than ever. Clients are expecting the benefits of turning infrastructure, platform and network into services payable per use without tolerating any service hiccups caused by performance bottlenecks or overprovision. This puts cloud providers under pressure to deliver data center management solutions and deployment plans in minimal time and with failure allowance close to none. Any comprehensive solution evaluation could gain much from the use of cloud simulators. Cloud simulators have the advantage of practicality over both mathematical proofs and real testbeds. They support any amount of heterogeneous use cases demanded by the cloud provider. Despite being a relatively new concept, multiple cloud simulators were developed. However, they are still in the phase of adapting to the scenarios, objectives and characteristics of the cloud. This paper examines a selected set of the current cloud simulators in terms of vision, features, and architecture. Strong points and limitations are discussed. Moreover, this paper presents a framework for cloud simulator design that can serve as an elaborate design checklist. A discussion of the open research challenges concludes the paper.},

  abstract = {A representative set of workflows found in bioinformatics pipelines must deal with large data sets. Most scientific workflows are defined as Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Despite DAGs are useful to understand dependence relationships, they do not provide any information about input, output and temporal data files. This information about the location of files of data intensive applications helps to avoid performance issues. This paper presents a multiworkflow store-aware scheduler in a cluster environment called Critical Path File Location (CPFL) policy where the access time to disk is more relevant than network, as an extension of the classical list scheduling policies. Our purpose is to find the best location of data files in a hierarchical storage system. The resulting algorithm is tested in an HPC cluster and in a simulated cluster scenario with bioinformatics synthetic workflows, and largely used benchmarks like Montage and Epigenomics. The resulting simulator is tuned and validated with the first test results from the real infrastructure. The evaluation of our proposal shows promising results up to 70\% on benchmarks in real HPC clusters using 128 cores and up to 69\% of makespan improvement on simulated 512 cores clusters with a deviation between 0.9\% and 3\% regarding the real HPC cluster.},

Demand response provides one such option to tackle the problems. The objective of this paper is to propose a solution for synchronous part transfer to have higher production rate under demand response available power constraint. To attain our objectives, we first model a synchronous part transfer line using queuing theory to characterize temporal behaviors such as arrival and departure of parts, and utilization of stations (or machines). Then, we propose an efficient scheduling algorithm that provides an optimal schedule taking into account the available power. We also provide illustrating examples and analytical and simulation results to show the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

These workflow applications consist of interconnected jobs and data. Nevertheless, hardly any initiations are tailored on multi-workflow scheduling exertion. These scheduling problems have been considered methodically in cloud atmosphere. Accessibility of the computing resources on the data center (DC) provides the exact time of execution of each process, whereas the execution time of every process within a workflow is pre-calculated in the majority of the existing multi-workflow scheduling problem. System overhead so far is an additional concern at the same time as dynamically generating virtual machines (VMs) with salvage them dipping the power eating. The aim of this paper is to reduce the execution time of every job and finalize the execution of all workflow within its deadline by producing VMs dynamically in DC and recycle them as necessary. We recommend a dynamic multi-workflow scheduling algorithm formally named as competent dynamic multi-workflow scheduling (CDMWS) algorithm. Simulation process describes one of the best algorithms so far in terms of performance among subsistent algorithm and moves toward a new era of multi-workflow relevance.},

  abstract = {A workflow is a set of steps or tasks that model the execution of a process, e.g., protein annotation, invoice generation and composition of astronomical images. Workflow applications commonly require large computational resources. Hence, distributed computing approaches (such as Grid and Cloud computing) emerge as a feasible solution to execute them. Two important factors for executing workflows in distributed computing platforms are (1) workflow scheduling and (2) resource allocation. As a consequence, there is a myriad of workflow scheduling algorithms that map workflow tasks to distributed resources subject to task dependencies, time and budget constraints. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of workflow scheduling algorithms, which categorizes the algorithms into (1) best-effort algorithms (including heuristics, metaheuristics, and approximation algorithms) and (2) quality-of-service algorithms (including budget-constrained, deadline-constrained and algorithms simultaneously constrained by deadline and budget). In addition, a workflow engine simulator was developed to quantitatively compare the performance of scheduling algorithms.},

  abstract = {Optimistic methods have been applied with success to single-objective optimization. Here, we attempt to bridge the gap between optimistic methods and multi-objective optimization. In particular, this paper is concerned with solving black-box multi-objective problems given a finite number of function evaluations and proposes an optimistic approach, which we refer to as the Multi-Objective Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization (MO-SOO). Popularized by multi-armed bandits, MO-SOO follows the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle to recognize Pareto optimal solutions, by combining several multi-armed bandits in a hierarchical structure over the feasible decision space of a multi-objective problem. Based on three assumptions about the objective functions smoothness and hierarchical partitioning, the algorithm finite-time and asymptotic convergence behaviors are analyzed. The finite-time analysis establishes an upper bound on the Pareto-compliant unary additive epsilon indicator characterized by the objectives smoothness as well as the structure of the Pareto front with respect to its extrema. On the other hand, the asymptotic analysis indicates the consistency property of MO-SOO. Moreover, we validate the theoretical provable performance of the algorithm on a set of synthetic problems. Finally, three-hundred bi-objective benchmark problems from the literature are used to substantiate the performance of the optimistic approach and compare it with three state-of-the-art stochastic algorithms in terms of two Pareto-compliant quality indicators. Besides sound theoretical properties, MO-SOO shows a performance on a par with the top performing stochastic algorithm.},

At the same time, relevant performance criteria and system distribution structure must be considered to solve specific WFS problems in cloud computing by providing different services to cloud users on pay-as-you-go and on-demand basis. In the literature, various WFS challenges affecting WFS execution cost have been discussed. However, prior work did not consider such challenges collectively. The main objective of this paper is to facilitate researchers in selecting appropriate cost-aware WFS approaches from the available pool of alternatives. To achieve this objective, we conducted an extensive review to investigate and analyze the underlying concepts of the relevant approaches. The cost-aware relevant challenges of WFS in cloud computing are classified based on Quality of Service (QoS) performance, system functionality and system architecture, which ultimately result in a taxonomy set. Some research opportunities are also discussed that help in identifying future research directions in the area of cloud computing. The findings of this review provide a roadmap for developing cost-aware models, which will motivate researchers to propose better cost-aware approaches for service consumers and/or utility providers in cloud computing.},

Several cost optimization approaches have been proposed to improve the economic aspect of Scientific Workflow Scheduling (SWFS) in cloud and grid computing. To date, the literature has not yet seen a comprehensive review that focuses on approaches for supporting cost optimization in the context of SWFS in cloud and grid computing. Furthermore, providing valuable guidelines and analysis to understand the cost optimization of SWFS approaches is not well-explored in the current literature. This paper aims to analyze the problem of cost optimization in SWFS by extensively surveying existing SWFS approaches in cloud and grid computing and provide a classification of cost optimization aspects and parameters of SWFS. Moreover, it provides a classification of cost based metrics that are categorized into monetary and temporal cost parameters based on various scheduling stages. We believe that our findings would help researchers and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate cost optimization approach considering identified aspects and parameters. In addition, we highlight potential future research directions in this on-going area of research.},

This difficulty is related to the rapid evaluation of Telecommunication and multimedia systems accompanied by a rapid increase of user requirements in terms of latency, execution time, consumption, energy, etc. Having an optimal scheduling on multi-cores DSP (Digital signal Processors) platforms is a challenging task. In this context, we present a novel technique and algorithm in order to find a valid schedule that optimizes the key performance metrics such as the latency. Our contribution is based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver technologies which is strongly driven by the industrial applications and needs. We use an approach which is based on the synchronous and hierarchical behavior of both Simulink and synchronous dataflow. Whence, results of running the scheduler using our proposed SMT solver algorithm refinements produce an optimal scheduling in terms of latency and numbers of cores.},

  abstract = {Manufacturing process planning is the process of selecting and sequencing manufacturing processes such that they achieve one or more goals and satisfy a set of domain constraints. Manufacturing scheduling is the process of selecting a process plan and assigning manufacturing resources for specific time periods to the set of manufacturing processes in the plan. It is, in fact, an optimization process by which limited manufacturing resources are allocated over time among parallel and sequential activities. Manufacturing process planning and scheduling are usually considered to be two separate and distinct phases. Traditional optimization approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints of both domains simultaneously and result in suboptimal solutions. Without considering real-time machine workloads and shop floor dynamics, process plans may become suboptimal or even invalid at the time of execution. Therefore, there is a need for the integration of manufacturing process-planning and scheduling systems for generating more realistic and effective plans. After describing the complexity of the manufacturing process-planning and scheduling problems, this paper reviews the research literature on manufacturing process planning, scheduling as well as their integration, particularly on agent-based approaches to these difficult problems. Major issues in these research areas are discussed, and research opportunities and challenges are identified},

In this paper, we present Expert Iteration (ExIt), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm which decomposes the problem into separate planning and generalisation tasks. Planning new policies is performed by tree search, while a deep neural network generalises those plans. Subsequently, tree search is improved by using the neural network policy to guide search, increasing the strength of new plans. In contrast, standard deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms rely on a neural network not only to generalise plans, but to discover them too. We show that ExIt outperforms REINFORCE for training a neural network to play the board game Hex, and our final tree search agent, trained tabula rasa, defeats MoHex 1.0, the most recent Olympiad Champion player to be publicly released.},

Commonly, applications have time and cost constraints such that all tasks of an application need to be finished within a user-specified Deadline and Budget. Several algorithms have been proposed for multiple QoS workflow scheduling, but most of them use search-based strategies that generally have a high time complexity, making them less useful in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we present a heuristic scheduling algorithm with quadratic time complexity that considers two important constraints for QoS-based workflow scheduling, time and cost, named Deadline\textendash Budget Constrained Scheduling (DBCS). From the deadline and budget defined by the user, the DBCS algorithm finds a feasible solution that accomplishes both constraints with a success rate similar to other state-of-the-art search-based algorithms in terms of the successful rate of feasible solutions, consuming in the worst case only approximately 4\% of the time. The DBCS algorithm has a low-time complexity of O(n2.p) for n tasks and p processors.},

There have been very substantial advances in the representation of workflows and in the engineering of workflow management systems (WMS). The creation and refinement stages are now well supported, with a significant improvement in usability. Improved abstraction supports cross-fertilisation between different workflow communities and consistent interpretation as WMS evolve. Through such re-engineering the WMS deliver much improved performance, significantly increased scale and sophisticated reliability mechanisms. Further improvement is anticipated from substantial advances in optimisation.

  abstract = {In the field of HPC, the current hardware trend is to design multiprocessor architectures featuring heterogeneous technologies such as specialized coprocessors (e.g. Cell/BE) or data-parallel accelerators (e.g. GPUs). Approaching the theoretical performance of these architectures is a complex issue. Indeed, substantial efforts have already been devoted to efficiently offload parts of the computations. However, designing an execution model that unifies all computing units and associated embedded memory remains a main challenge. We therefore designed StarPU, an original runtime system providing a high-level, unified execution model tightly coupled with an expressive data management library. The main goal of StarPU is to provide numerical kernel designers with a convenient way to generate parallel tasks over heterogeneous hardware on the one hand, and easily develop and tune powerful scheduling algorithms on the other hand. We have developed several strategies that can be selected seamlessly at run-time, and we have analyzed their efficiency on several algorithms running simultaneously over multiple cores and a GPU. In addition to substantial improvements regarding execution times, we have obtained consistent superlinear parallelism by actually exploiting the heterogeneous nature of the machine. We eventually show that our dynamic approach competes with the highly optimized MAGMA library and overcomes the limitations of the corresponding static scheduling in a portable way.

  abstract = {Background:
Hospital pharmacy is responsible for controlling and monitoring the medication use process and ensures the timely access to safe, effective and economical use of drugs and medicines for patients and hospital staff.

Objectives:
This study aimed to optimize the management of studied outpatient pharmacy by developing suitable queuing theory and simulation technique.

Patients and Methods:
A descriptive-analytical study conducted in a military hospital in Iran, Tehran in 2013. A sample of 220 patients referred to the outpatient pharmacy of the hospital in two shifts, morning and evening, was selected to collect the necessary data to determine the arrival rate, service rate, and other data needed to calculate the patients flow and queuing network performance variables. After the initial analysis of collected data using the software SPSS 18, the pharmacy queuing network performance indicators were calculated for both shifts. Then, based on collected data and to provide appropriate solutions, the queuing system of current situation for both shifts was modeled and simulated using the software ARENA 12 and 4 scenarios were explored.

Results:
Results showed that the queue characteristics of the studied pharmacy during the situation analysis were very undesirable in both morning and evening shifts. The average numbers of patients in the pharmacy were 19.21 and 14.66 in the morning and evening, respectively. The average times spent in the system by clients were 39 minutes in the morning and 35 minutes in the evening. The system utilization in the morning and evening were, respectively, 25\% and 21\%. The simulation results showed that reducing the staff in the morning from 2 to 1 in the receiving prescriptions stage didn't change the queue performance indicators. Increasing one staff in filling prescription drugs could cause a decrease of 10 persons in the average queue length and 18 minutes and 14 seconds in the average waiting time. On the other hand, simulation results showed that in the evening, decreasing the staff from 2 to 1 in the delivery of prescription drugs, changed the queue performance indicators very little. Increasing a staff to fill prescription drugs could cause a decrease of 5 persons in the average queue length and 8 minutes and 44 seconds in the average waiting time.

Conclusions:
The patients' waiting times and the number of patients waiting to receive services in both shifts could be reduced by using multitasking persons and reallocating them to the time-consuming stage of filling prescriptions, using queuing theory and simulation techniques.},

  abstract = {Demand response program with real-time pricing can encourage electricity users toward scheduling their energy usage to off-peak hours. A user needs to schedule the energy usage of his appliances in an online manner since he may not know the energy prices and the demand of his appliances ahead of time. In this paper, we study the users' long-term load scheduling problem and model the changes of the price information and load demand as a Markov decision process, which enables us to capture the interactions among users as a partially observable stochastic game. To make the problem tractable, we approximate the users' optimal scheduling policy by the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) of a fully observable stochastic game with incomplete information. We develop an online load scheduling learning (LSL) algorithm based on the actor-critic method to determine the users' MPE policy. When compared with the benchmark of not performing demand response, simulation results show that the LSL algorithm can reduce the expected cost of users and the peak-to-average ratio in the aggregate load by 28\% and 13\%, respectively. When compared with the short-term scheduling policies, the users with the long-term policies can reduce their expected cost by 17\%.},

  abstract = {Nowadays large-scale distributed machine learning systems have been deployed to support various analytics and intelligence services in IT firms. To train a large dataset and derive the prediction/inference model, e.g., a deep neural network, multiple workers are run in parallel to train partitions of the input dataset, and update shared model parameters. In a shared cluster handling multiple training jobs, a fundamental issue is how to efficiently schedule jobs and set the number of concurrent workers to run for each job, such that server resources are maximally utilized and model training can be completed in time. Targeting a distributed machine learning system using the parameter server framework, we design an online algorithm for scheduling the arriving jobs and deciding the adjusted numbers of concurrent workers and parameter servers for each job over its course, to maximize overall utility of all jobs, contingent on their completion times. Our online algorithm design utilizes a primal-dual framework coupled with efficient dual subroutines, achieving good long-term performance guarantees with polynomial time complexity. Practical effectiveness of the online algorithm is evaluated using trace-driven simulation and testbed experiments, which demonstrate its outperformance as compared to commonly adopted scheduling algorithms in today's cloud systems.},

Furthermore, there exists a growing interest in the application of Artificial Intelligence Planning and Scheduling techniques to automate the production and execution of models of organization. However, from our point of view, several connections between both disciplines remains to be exploited. The current work presents a proposal for modelling and enacting business processes that involve the selection and order of the activities to be executed (planning), besides the resource allocation (scheduling), considering the optimization of several functions and the reach of some objectives. The main novelty is that all decisions (even the activities selection) are taken in run-time considering the actual parameters of the execution, so the business process is managed in an efficient and flexible way. As an example, a complex and representative problem, the repair planning problem, is managed through the proposed approach.},

The simulation results show a better cluster usage. The scheduling algorithm minimizes the total length of the schedule (makespan) of a given set of parallel jobs, whose priorities are represented in a DAG.

  abstract = {The scheduling of workflow applications involves the mapping of individual workflow tasks to computational resources, based on a range of functional and non-functional quality of service requirements. Workflow applications such as scientific workflows often require extensive computational processing and generate significant amounts of experimental data. The emergence of cloud computing has introduced a utility-type market model, where computational resources of varying capacities can be procured on demand, in a pay-per-use fashion. In workflow based applications dependencies exist amongst tasks which requires the generation of schedules in accordance with defined precedence constraints. These constraints pose a difficult planning problem, where tasks must be scheduled for execution only once all their parent tasks have completed. In general the two most important objectives of workflow schedulers are the minimisation of both cost and make span. The cost of workflow execution consists of both computational costs incurred from processing individual tasks, and data transmission costs. With scientific workflows potentially large amounts of data must be transferred between compute and storage sites. This paper proposes a novel cloud workflow scheduling approach which employs a Markov Decision Process to optimally guide the workflow execution process depending on environmental state. In addition the system employs a genetic algorithm to evolve workflow schedules. The overall architecture is presented, and initial results indicate the potential of this approach for developing viable workflow schedules on the Cloud.},

  abstract = {Over the last 2-3 years, the importance of data-intensive computing has increasingly been recognized, closely coupled with the emergence and popularity of map-reduce for developing this class of applications. Besides programmability and ease of parallelization, fault tolerance is clearly important for data-intensive applications, because of their long running nature, and because of the potential for using a large number of nodes for processing massive amounts of data. Fault-tolerance has been an important attribute of map-reduce as well in its Hadoop implementation, where it is based on replication of data in the file system. Two important goals in supporting fault-tolerance are low overheads and efficient recovery. With these goals, this paper describes a different approach for enabling data-intensive computing with fault-tolerance. Our approach is based on an API for developing data-intensive computations that is a variation of map-reduce, and it involves an explicit programmer-declared reduction object. We show how more efficient fault-tolerance support can be developed using this API. Particularly, as the reduction object represents the state of the computation on a node, we can periodically cache the reduction object from every node at another location and use it to support failure-recovery. We have extensively evaluated our approach using two data-intensive applications. Our results show that the overheads of our scheme are extremely low, and our system outperforms Hadoop both in absence and presence of failures.},

  abstract = {There are many systems and techniques that address stochastic planning and scheduling problems, based on distinct and sometimes opposite approaches, especially in terms of how generation and execution of the plan, or the schedule, are combined, and if and when knowledge about the uncertainties is taken into account. In many real-life problems, it appears that many of these approaches are needed and should be combined, which to our knowledge has never been done. In this paper, we propose a typology that distinguishes between proactive, progressive, and revision approaches. Then, focusing on scheduling and schedule execution, a theoretic model integrating those three approaches is defined. This model serves as a general template to implement a system that will fit specific application needs: we introduce and discuss our experimental prototypes which validate our model in part, and suggest how this framework could be extended to more general planning systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach to aggregating and using devices that support the everyday life of human users in ambient intelligence environments. These execution environments are complex and changing over time, since the devices of the environments are numerous and heterogeneous, and they may appear or disappear at any time. In order to appropriately adapt the ambient system to a user's needs, we adopt a service-oriented approach; i.e., devices provide services that reflect their capabilities. The orchestration of the devices is actually realized with the help of Artificial Intelligence planning techniques and dynamic service binding. At design time, (i) a planning problem is created that consists of the user's goal to be achieved and the services currently offered by the intelligent environment, (ii) the planning problem is then solved using Hierarchical Task Network and Partial-Order Causal-Link planning techniques, (iii) and from the planning decisions taken to find solution plans, abstract service workflows are automatically generated. At run time, the abstract services are dynamically bound to devices that are actually present in the environment. Adaptation of the workflow instantiation is possible due to the late binding mechanism employed. The paper depicts the architecture of our system. It also describes the modeling and the life cycle of the workflows. We discuss the advantages and the limit of our approach with respect to related work and give specific details about implementation. We present some experimental results that validate our system in a real-world application scenario.},

  abstract = {The start of operations of the VISTA survey telescope will not only offer a new facility to the ESO community, but also a new way of observing. Survey observation programs typically observe large areas of the sky and might span several years, corresponding to the execution of hundreds of observations blocks (OBs) in service mode. However, the execution time of an individual survey OB will often be rather short. We expect that up to twelve OBs may be executed per hour, as opposed to about one OB per hour on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). OBs of different programs are competing for observation time and must be executed with adequate priority. For these reasons, the scheduling of survey OBs is required to be almost fully automated. Two new key concepts are introduced to address these challenges: ESO's phase 2 proposal preparation tool P2PP allows PIs of survey programs to express advanced mid-term observing strategies using scheduling containers of OBs (groups, timelinks, concatenations). Telescope operators are provided with effective shortterm decision support based on ranking observable OBs. The ranking takes into account both empirical probability distributions of various constraints and the observing strategy described by the scheduling containers. We introduce the three scheduling container types and describe how survey OBs are ranked. We demonstrate how the new concepts are implemented in the preparation and observing tools and give an overview of the end-to-end workflow.},

With the evolution of e-Science, workflows are becoming larger and more computational demanding. Such e-Science necessities match with what computational Grids have to offer. Grids are shared distributed platforms which will eventually receive multiple requisitions to execute workflows. With this, there is a demand for a scheduler which deals with multiple workflows in the same set of resources, thus the development of multiple workflow scheduling algorithms is necessary. In this paper we describe four different initial strategies for scheduling multiple workflows on Grids and evaluate them in terms of schedule length and fairness. We present results for the initial schedule and for the makespan after the execution with external load. From the results we conclude that interleaving the workflows on the Grid leads to good average makespan and provides fairness when multiple workflows share the same set of resources.},

In this paper we introduce a classification of the scheduling problem in distributed systems by presenting a taxonomy that incorporates recent developments, especially those in cloud computing. We review the scheduling literature to corroborate the taxonomy and analyze the interest in different branches of the proposed taxonomy.

Resources, depending on their nature, may be classified into types and categories. The classification into types takes into account only the functions resources fulfill: resources of the same type are assumed to fulfill the same functions. The classification into categories will concern two points of view. First, we differentiate three categories of resources from the viewpoint of resource constraints. We will call a resource renewable, if only its total usage, i.e. temporary availability at every moment, is constrained. A resource is called non-renewable, if only its total consumption, i.e. integral availability up to any given moment, is constrained (in other words this resource once used by some task cannot be assigned to any other task). A resource is called doubly constrained, if both total usage and total consumption are constrained. Secondly, we distinguish two resource categories from the viewpoint of resource divisibility: discrete (i.e. discretely-divisible) and continuous (i.e. continuously-divisible) resources. In other words, by a discrete resource we will understand a resource which can be allocated to tasks in discrete amounts from a given finite set of possible allocations, which in particular may consist of one element only. Continuous resources, on the other hand, can be allocated in arbitrary, a priori unknown, amounts from given intervals.},

We compare the behavior of workflow-based algorithms and task-based algorithms, using simulations of workflows drawn from a real application and with varying ratios of computation cost to data transfer cost.

  abstract = {Mixed-machine heterogeneous computing (HC) environments utilize a distributed suite of different high-performance machines, interconnected with high-speed links, to perform different computationally intensive applications that have diverse computational requirements. HC environments are well suited to meet the computational demands of large, diverse groups of tasks. The problem of optimally mapping (defined as matching and scheduling) these tasks onto the machines of a distributed HC environment has been shown, in general, to be NP-complete, requiring the development of heuristic techniques. Selecting the best heuristic to use in a given environment, however, remains a difficult problem, because comparisons are often clouded by different underlying assumptions in the original study of each heuristic. Therefore, a collection of 11 heuristics from the literature has been selected, adapted, implemented, and analyzed under one set of common assumptions. It is assumed that the heuristics derive a mapping statically (i.e., off-line). It is also assumed that a metatask (i.e., a set of independent, noncommunicating tasks) is being mapped and that the goal is to minimize the total execution time of the metatask. The 11 heuristics examined are Opportunistic Load Balancing, Minimum Execution Time, Minimum Completion Time, Min\textendash min, Max\textendash min, Duplex, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Simulated Annealing, Tabu, and A*. This study provides one even basis for comparison and insights into circumstances where one technique will out-perform another. The evaluation procedure is specified, the heuristics are defined, and then comparison results are discussed. It is shown that for the cases studied here, the relatively simple Min\textendash min heuristic performs well in comparison to the other techniques.},

Allocation and Scheduling in the general case are well-known NP-hard problems, forcing commercial schedulers to adopt greedy approaches to improve performance and QoS. Search-based approaches featuring the exploration of the solution space have seldom been employed in this setting, but mostly applied in off-line scenarios. In this paper, we present the first search-based approach to job allocation and scheduling for HPC machines, working in a production environment. The scheduler is based on Constraint Programming, an effective programming technique for optimization problems. The resulting scheduler is flexible, as it can be easily customized for dealing with heterogeneous resources, user-defined constraints and different metrics. We evaluate our solution both on virtual machines using synthetic workloads, and on the Eurora HPC with production workloads. Tests on a wide range of operating conditions show significant improvements in waitings and QoS in mid-tier HPC machines w.r.t state-of-the-art commercial rule-based dispatchers. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which our approach outperforms commercial approaches, to create a portfolio of scheduling algorithms that ensures robustness, flexibility and scalability.},

Fuzzy representations for approximate, model-free RL have been proposed in the literature for the more difficult case where the state-action space is continuous. In this work, we propose a fuzzy approximation architecture similar to those previously used for Q-learning, but we combine it with the model-based Q-value iteration algorithm. We prove that the resulting algorithm converges. We also give a modified, asynchronous variant of the algorithm that converges at least as fast as the original version.

At the same time, the amounts of data generated in various areas of science outpaced enhancements in computational power and storage capabilities. This is especially true for the life sciences, where new technologies increased the sequencing throughput from kilobytes to terabytes per day. This trend requires current SWfMS to adapt: Native support for parallel workflow execution must be provided to increase performance; dynamically scalable ``pay-per-use'' compute infrastructures have to be integrated to diminish hardware costs; adaptive scheduling of workflows in distributed compute environments is required to optimize resource utilization. In this survey we give an overview of parallelization techniques for SWfMS, both in theory and in their realization in concrete systems. We find that current systems leave considerable room for improvement and we propose key advancements to the landscape of SWfMS.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing is a recent advancement wherein IT infrastructure and applications are provided as `services' to end-users under a usage-based payment model. It can leverage virtualized services even on the fly based on requirements (workload patterns and QoS) varying with time. The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Evaluating the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in a repeatable manner under varying system and user configurations and requirements is difficult to achieve. To overcome this challenge, we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modeling and simulation of Cloud computing systems and application provisioning environments. The CloudSim toolkit supports both system and behavior modeling of Cloud system components such as data centers, virtual machines (VMs) and resource provisioning policies. It implements generic application provisioning techniques that can be extended with ease and limited effort. Currently, it supports modeling and simulation of Cloud computing environments consisting of both single and inter-networked clouds (federation of clouds). Moreover, it exposes custom interfaces for implementing policies and provisioning techniques for allocation of VMs under inter-networked Cloud computing scenarios. Several researchers from organizations, such as HP Labs in U.S.A., are using CloudSim in their investigation on Cloud resource provisioning and energy-efficient management of data center resources. The usefulness of CloudSim is demonstrated by a case study involving dynamic provisioning of application services in the hybrid federated clouds environment. The result of this case study proves that the federated Cloud computing model significantly improves the application QoS requirements under fluctuating resource and service demand patterns.

Using over 8 months of data collection on 6 identical systems, we propose and validate a modeling and analysis approach (MOANA) that predicts HPC I/O variability for thousands of software and hardware configurations on highly parallel shared-memory systems.

We use a realistic application/platform model with stochastic task weights, and VMs communicating through a datacenter. We extend two well-known algorithms, MinMin and HEFT, and make scheduling decisions based upon machine availability and available budget. During the mapping process, the budget-aware algorithms make conservative assumptions to avoid exceeding the initial budget; we further improve our results with refined versions that aim at re-scheduling some tasks onto faster VMs, thereby spending any budget fraction leftover by the first allocation. These refined variants are much more time-consuming than the former algorithms, so there is a trade-off to find in terms of scalability. We report an extensive set of simulations with workflows from the Pegasus benchmark suite. Most of the time our budget-aware algorithms succeed in achieving efficient makespans while enforcing the given budget, despite (i) the uncertainty in task weights and (ii) the heterogeneity of VMs in both cost and speed values.},

  abstract = {Scientific workflows are used routinely in numerous scientific domains, and Workflow Management Systems (WMSs) have been developed to orchestrate and optimize workflow executions on distributed platforms. WMSs are complex software systems that interact with complex software infrastructures. Most WMS research and development activities rely on empirical experiments conducted with full-fledged software stacks on actual hardware platforms. Such experiments, however, are limited to hardware and software infrastructures at hand and can be labor- and/or time-intensive. As a result, relying solely on real-world experiments impedes WMS research and development. An alternative is to conduct experiments in simulation. In this work we present WRENCH, a WMS simulation framework, whose objectives are (i) accurate and scalable simulations; and (ii) easy simulation software development. WRENCH achieves its first objective by building on the SimGrid framework. While SimGrid is recognized for the accuracy and scalability of its simulation models, it only provides low-level simulation abstractions and thus large software development efforts are required when implementing simulators of complex systems. WRENCH thus achieves its second objective by providing high- level and directly re-usable simulation abstractions on top of SimGrid. After describing and giving rationales for WRENCH's software architecture and APIs, we present a case study in which we apply WRENCH to simulate the Pegasus production WMS. We report on ease of implementation, simulation accuracy, and simulation scalability so as to determine to which extent WRENCH achieves its two above objectives. We also draw both qualitative and quantitative comparisons with a previously proposed workflow simulator.},

Although cloud provider (e.g., Amazon Web Services) and application provider (e.g., biologists, physicists, and online gaming companies) both have specific performance requirements (e.g. application response time), it is the cloud scheduler's responsibility to map the application to underlying cloud resources. This article presents a Balanced and file Reuse\textendash Replication Scheduling (BaRRS) algorithm for cloud computing environments to optimally schedule scientific application workflows. BaRRS splits scientific workflows into multiple sub-workflows to balance system utilization via parallelization. It also exploits data reuse and replication techniques to optimize the amount of data that needs to be transferred among tasks at run-time. BaRRS analyzes the key application features (e.g., task execution times, dependency patterns and file sizes) of scientific workflows for adapting existing data reuse and replication techniques to cloud systems. Further, BaRRS performs a trade-off analysis to select the optimal solution based on two optimization constraints: execution time and monetary cost of running scientific workflows. BaRRS is compared with a state-of-the-art scheduling approach; experiments prove its superior performance. Experiments include four well known scientific workflows with different dependency patterns and data file sizes. Results were promising and also highlighted most critical factors affecting execution of scientific applications on clouds.},

Mexar2 supports space mission planners continuously as they plan data downlinks from the spacecraft to Earth. The tool lets planners work at a higher abstraction level while it performs low-level, often-repetitive tasks. It also helps them produce a plan rapidly, explore alternative solutions, and choose the most robust plan for execution. Additionally, planners can analyze any problems over multiple days and identify payload overcommitments that cause resource bottlenecks and increase the risk of data losses.

  abstract = {Large-scale distributed computing systems like grids and more recently clouds are a platform of choice for many resource-intensive applications. Workflow applications account for the majority of these applications, particularly in science and engineering. A workflow application consists of multiple precedence-constrained tasks with data dependencies. Since resources in those systems are shared by many users and applications deployed there are very diverse, scheduling is complicated. Often, the actual execution of applications differs from the original schedule following delays such as those caused by resource contention and other issues in performance prediction. These delays have further impact when running multiple workflow applications due to inter-task dependencies. In this paper, we investigate the problem of scheduling multiple workflow applications concurrently, explicitly taking into account scheduling robustness. We present a dynamic task rearrangement and rescheduling algorithm that exploits the scheduling flexibility from precedence constraints among tasks. The algorithm optimizes resource allocation among multiple workflows, and it often stops the influence of delayed execution passing to subsequent tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve performance in multiple-workflow scheduling.},

Minimizing the schedule length while satisfying the budget constraint of an application is one of the most important quality of service requirements for cloud providers. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) can be used to describe an application consisted of multiple tasks with precedence constrains. Previous DAG scheduling methods tried to presuppose the minimum cost assignment for each task to minimize the schedule length of budget constrained applications on heterogeneous cloud computing systems. However, our analysis revealed that the preassignment of tasks with the minimum cost does not necessarily lead to the minimization of the schedule length. In this study, we propose an efficient algorithm of minimizing the schedule length using the budget level (MSLBL) to select processors for satisfying the budget constraint and minimizing the schedule length of an application. Such problem is decomposed into two sub-problems, namely, satisfying the budget constraint and minimizing the schedule length. The first sub-problem is solved by transferring the budget constraint of the application to that of each task, and the second sub-problem is solved by heuristically scheduling each task with low-time complexity. Experimental results on several real parallel applications validate that the proposed MSLBL algorithm can obtain shorter schedule lengths while satisfying the budget constraint of an application than existing methods in various situations.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing has become an attractive computing paradigm in both academia and industry. Through virtualization technology, Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) that own data centers can structure physical servers into Virtual Machines (VMs) to provide services, resources, and infrastructures to users. Profit-driven CSPs charge users for service access and VM rental, and reduce power consumption and electric bills so as to increase profit margin. The key challenge faced by CSPs is data center energy cost minimization. Prior works proposed various algorithms to reduce energy cost through Resource Provisioning (RP) and/or Task Scheduling (TS). However, they have scalability issues or do not consider TS with task dependencies, which is a crucial factor that ensures correct parallel execution of tasks. This paper presents DRL-Cloud, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based RP and TS system, to minimize energy cost for large-scale CSPs with very large number of servers that receive enormous numbers of user requests per day. A deep Q-learning-based two-stage RP-TS processor is designed to automatically generate the best long-term decisions by learning from the changing environment such as user request patterns and realistic electric price. With training techniques such as target network, experience replay, and exploration and exploitation, the proposed DRL-Cloud achieves remarkably high energy cost efficiency, low reject rate as well as low runtime with fast convergence. Compared with one of the state-of-the-art energy efficient algorithms, the proposed DRL-Cloud achieves up to 320\% energy cost efficiency improvement while maintaining lower reject rate on average. For an example CSP setup with 5,000 servers and 200,000 tasks, compared to a fast round-robin baseline, the proposed DRL-Cloud achieves up to 144\% runtime reduction.},

However, existing efficient schedulers require a priori coflow information and ignore cluster dynamics like pipelining, task failures, and speculative executions, which limit their applicability. Schedulers without prior knowledge compromise on performance to avoid head-of-line blocking. In this paper, we present Aalo that strikes a balance and efficiently schedules coflows without prior knowledge. Aalo employs Discretized Coflow-Aware Least-Attained Service (D-CLAS) to separate coflows into a small number of priority queues based on how much they have already sent across the cluster. By performing prioritization across queues and by scheduling coflows in the FIFO order within each queue, Aalo's non-clairvoyant scheduler reduces coflow completion times while guaranteeing starvation freedom. EC2 deployments and trace-driven simulations show that communication stages complete 1.93X faster on average and 3.59X faster at the 95th percentile using Aalo in comparison to per-flow mechanisms. Aalo's performance is comparable to that of solutions using prior knowledge, and Aalo outperforms them in presence of cluster dynamics.},

The proposed scheduling policy improves performance by prioritizing the newly-created tasks at runtime, detecting the longest path of the dynamic task dependency graph, and assigning critical tasks to fast cores. While previous works use profiling information and are static, this dynamic scheduling approach uses information that is discoverable at runtime which makes it implementable and functional without the need of an oracle or profiling. The evaluation results show that our proposal outperforms a dynamic implementation of Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time by up to 1.15x, and the default breadth-first OmpSs scheduler by up to 1.3x in an 8-core heterogeneous platform and up to 2.7x in a simulated 128-core chip.},

Key to successful and cost-efficient operations of the SOFIA airborne observatory is the optimized scheduling of operational activities. These include instrument, observation and maintenance schedules, as well as Southern Hemisphere deployments. The most distinctive aspect of the SOFIA flight scheduling problem is the interdependency of the targets than can be observed in a same flight, which makes automated scheduling techniques available for ground-based and space-based telescopes unsuitable. SOFIA began early science operations in 2011 and is currently completing its fourth annual cycle of operations, which consists of about 550 hours of observer time carried out during 100 science flights. Although early conceptual studies on the SOFIA scheduling problem were previously conducted, flights still had to be manually created when operations started. Here, we introduce the new automated scheduling system based on a tree search algorithm that is used to generate long-term and short-term operational schedules. We provide a formulation of the SOFIA scheduling problem, as defined after 5 years of operations, including all constraints that a valid schedule must satisfy. We list the flight operational tasks that must be efficiently simulated while building the global search tree. We discuss the foundations of the scheduler and describe the constraint representation, algorithm and heuristics that guide the search. Finally, we report on the integration of the automated system in mission operations and its current and future expected performance.},

Few works consider the integration of different kinds of constraints, they are usually based on declarative frameworks and they are often exact methods, which either enumerate all the solutions satisfying the user constraints, or find a global optimum when an optimization criterion is specified. In a previous work, we have proposed a model for Constrained Clustering based on a Constraint Programming framework. It is declarative, allowing a user to integrate user constraints and to choose an optimization criterion among several ones. In this article we present a new and substantially improved model for Constrained Clustering, still based on a Constraint Programming framework. It differs from our earlier model in the way partitions are represented by means of variables and constraints. It is also more flexible since the number of clusters does not need to be set beforehand; only a lower and an upper bound on the number of clusters have to be provided. In order to make the model-based approach more efficient, we propose new global optimization constraints with dedicated filtering algorithms. We show that such a framework can easily be embedded in a more general process and we illustrate this on the problem of finding the optimal Pareto front of a bi-criterion constrained clustering task. We compare our approach with existing exact approaches, based either on a branch-and-bound approach or on graph coloring on twelve datasets. Experiments show that the model outperforms exact approaches in most cases.},

  abstract = {Task allocation and scheduling for heterogeneous multicore platforms must be automated for such platforms to be successful. Techniques such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) provide the ability to easily customize the allocation and scheduling problem to application or platform-specific peculiarities. The representation of the core problem in a MILP form has a large impact on the solution time required. In this paper, we investigate a variety of such representations and propose a taxonomy for them. A promising representation is chosen with extensive computational characterization. The MILP formulation is customized for a multimedia case study involving the deployment of a Motion JPEG encoder application onto a Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA platform. We demonstrate that our approach can produce solutions that are competitive with manual designs.},

  abstract = {As the name suggests, multi-objective optimization involves optimizing a number of objectives simultaneously. The problem becomes challenging when the objectives are of conflict to each other, that is, the optimal solution of an objective function is different from that of the other. In solving such problems, with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Due to the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved suitably using evolutionary algorithms which use a population approach in its search procedure. Starting with parameterized procedures in early nineties, the so-called evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms is now an established field of research and application with many dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and workshops held at all major evolutionary computing conferences, and full-time researchers from universities and industries from all around the globe. In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction to its operating principles and outline the current research and application studies of EMO.},

These workflows describe the execution of a complex application built from individual application components. In our work we have developed two workflow generators: the first (the Concrete Workflow Generator CWG) maps an abstract workflow defined in terms of application-level components to the set of available Grid resources. The second generator (Abstract and Concrete Workflow Generator, ACWG) takes a wider perspective and not only performs the abstract to concrete mapping but also enables the construction of the abstract workflow based on the available components. This system operates in the application domain and chooses application components based on the application metadata attributes. We describe our current ACWG based on AI planning technologies and outline how these technologies can play a crucial role in developing complex application workflows in Grid environments. Although our work is preliminary, CWG has already been used to map high energy physics applications onto the Grid. In one particular experiment, a set of production runs lasted 7 days and resulted in the generation of 167,500 events by 678 jobs. Additionally, ACWG was used to map gravitational physics workflows, with hundreds of nodes onto the available resources, resulting in 975 tasks, 1365 data transfers and 975 output files produced.},

  abstract = {Maintaining player immersion is a crucial step in making an enjoyable video game. One aspect of player immersion is the level of challenge the game presents to the player. To avoid a mismatch between a player's skill and the challenge of a game, which can result from traditional manual difficulty selection mechanisms (e.g. easy, medium, hard), Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) has previously been proposed as a means of automatically detecting a player's skill and adjusting the level of challenge the game presents accordingly. This work contributes to the field of DDA by proposing a novel approach to artificially intelligent agents for opponent control. Specifically, we propose four new DDA Artificially Intelligent (AI) agents: Reactive Outcome Sensitive Action Selection (Reactive OSAS), Proactive OSAS, and their ``True'' variants. These agents provide the player with an level of difficulty tailored to their skill in realtime by altering the action selection policy and the heuristic playout evaluation of Monte Carlo Tree Search. The DDA AI agents are tested within the FightingICE engine, which has been used in the past as an environment for AI agent competitions. The results of the experiments against other AI agents and human players show that these novel DDA AI agents can adjust the level of difficulty in real-time, by targeting a zero health difference as the outcome of the fighting game. This work also demonstrates the trade-off existing between targeting the outcome exactly (Reactive OSAS) and introducing proactive behaviour (i.e., the DDA AI agent fights even if the health difference is zero) to increase the agents believability (Proactive OSAS).},

The procedure is based on a depth-first solution strategy in which nodes in the solution tree represent resource and precedence feasible partial schedules. Branches emanating from a parent node correspond to exhaustive and minimal combinations of activities, the delay of which resolves resource conflicts at each parent node. Precedence and resource-based bounds described in the paper are combined with new dominance pruning rules to rapidly fathom major portions of the solution tree. The procedure is programmed in the C language for use on both a mainframe and a personal computer. The procedure has been validated using a standard set of test problems with between 7 and 50 activities requiring up to three resource types each. Computational experience on a personal computer indicates that the procedure is 11.6 times faster than the most rapid solution procedure reported in the literature while requiring less computer storage. Moreover, problems requiring large amounts of computer time using existing approaches for solving this problem type are rapidly solved with our procedure using the dominance rules described, resulting in a significant reduction in the variability in solution times as well.},

We prove that the length of the schedule returned by our algorithm is always within O(log n)-factor of the optimum that can be achieved with any selection of configurations for the tasks. We implement and test our algorithm on simulations of real application DAGs. We find that our divide-and-conquer method improves performance by up to 75\% compared to greedy scheduling algorithms.},

To achieve this goal, an efficient Grid scheduling system is an essential part of the Grid. Rather than covering the whole Grid scheduling area, this survey provides a review of the subject mainly from the perspective of scheduling algorithms. In this review, the challenges for Grid scheduling are identified. First, the architecture of components involved in scheduling is briefly introduced to provide an intuitive image of the Grid scheduling process. Then various Grid scheduling algorithms are discussed from different points of view, such as static vs. dynamic policies, objective functions, applications models, adaptation, QoS constraints, strategies dealing with dynamic behavior of resources, and so on. Based on a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and the state of the art of current research, some general issues worthy of further exploration are proposed.},

However, due to the increasingly high charge cost of using cloud service, cost minimization for workflows execution on cloud systems has become a crucial issue. Traditional work are adopting the sophisticated scheduling techniques to address such issue. Differently, this paper has proposed an efficient task-clustering based cost-effective aware scheduling algorithm (ECOS) to minimize the cost without comprising the deadline constraint. First, with respect to the characteristics of multi-type workflows, cloud heterogeneity and cost model, we have formulated the problem of task-clustering to simplify the structure of workflows and workflow scheduling to minimize cost within the deadline constraint. Then, we have devised ECOS with two key steps: (1) vertical clustering is with the time consideration that selectively merges the sequential tasks to reduce the transferring time within the workflow; (2) horizontal clustering and greedy allocation is to aggregate the parallel tasks and greedily allocate resources to that tasks with the aim of minimizing cost within deadline. Last, we have conducted the experiment that compare with well-known task-clustering based algorithms via WorkflowSim platform. The results have demonstrated that ECOS can efficiently merge tasks and minimize the total cost without comprising the deadline constraint both in small and large datasets. Moreover, we have discussed the ECOS in terms of various schedulers and number of tasks to validate the performance of ECOS.},

Because task scheduling is a Nondeterministic Polynomial (NP)-hard problem, many evolutionary algorithms have been adopted to solve this problem.

Thus, in this paper, to optimize the task scheduling makespan, a hybrid particle swarm optimization and hill climbing algorithm is proposed. The experimental results on random and scientific Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) showed that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in terms of the makespan compared to the current well-known heuristic and particle swarm optimization algorithms.},

Research work done so far mainly focused on reducing cost as well as execution time. In order to minimize cost and execution time previously existing workflow scheduling model known as predict earliest finish time is used. In this research work we have proposed a new PEFT genetic algorithm approach to further reduce the execution time on this model.

This paper addresses the scheduling problem of large-scale applications inspired from real-world, characterized by a huge number of homogeneous and concurrent bags-of-tasks that are the main sources of bottlenecks but open great potential for optimization. The scheduling problem is formulated as a new sequential cooperative game and propose a communication and storage-aware multi-objective algorithm that optimizes two user objectives (execution time and economic cost) while fulfilling two constraints (network bandwidth and storage requirements). We present comprehensive experiments using both simulation and real-world applications that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in terms of algorithm complexity, makespan, cost, system-level efficiency, fairness, and other aspects compared with other related algorithms.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, scientists and companies are confronted with multiple competing goals such as makespan in high-performance computing and economic cost in Clouds that have to be simultaneously optimized. Multi-objective scheduling of scientific workflows in distributed systems is therefore receiving increasing research attention. Most existing approaches typically aggregate all objectives in a single function, defined a-priori without any knowledge about the problem being solved, which negatively impacts the quality of the solutions. In contrast, Pareto-based approaches having as outcome a set of several (nearly-) optimal solutions that represent a tradeoff among the different objectives, have been scarcely studied. In this paper, we propose a new Pareto-based list scheduling heuristic that provides the user with a set of tradeoff optimal solutions from where the one that better suits the user requirements can be manually selected. We demonstrate the potential of MOHEFT for a bi-objective scheduling problem that optimizes makespan and economic cost in a Cloud-based computing scenario. We compare MOHEFT with two state-of-the-art approaches using different synthetic and real-world workflows: the classical HEFT algorithm used in single-objective scheduling and the SPEA2* genetic algorithm used for multi-objective optimisation problems.},

However, their study is problematic since they are critical production systems, where experimenting is extremely costly due to downtime and energy costs. Meanwhile, many scheduling algorithms emerging from theoretical studies have not been transferred to production tools for lack of realistic experimental validation. To tackle these problems we propose Batsim, an extendable, language-independent and scalable RJMS simulator. It allows researchers and engineers to test and compare any scheduling algorithm, using a simple event-based communication interface, which allows different levels of realism. In this paper we show that Batsim's behaviour matches the one of the real RJMS OAR. Our evaluation process was made with reproducibility in mind and all the experiment material is freely available.},

Despite several attempts, real applications of these techniques in cloud computing infrastructures face some difficulties. Some of them essentially turn back to the core concepts of automatic control: controllability, inertia of the controlled system, gain and stability. In this paper, considering our recent work to build a management framework dedicated to automatic resource allocation in virtualized applications, we attempt to identify from experiments the sources of instabilities in the controlled systems. As examples, we analyze two types of policies: threshold-based and reinforcement learning techniques to dynamically scale resources. The experiments show that both approaches are tricky and that trying to implement a controller without looking at the way the controlled system reacts to actions, both in time and in amplitude, is doomed to fail. We discuss both lessons learned from the experiments in terms of simple yet key points to build good resource management policies, and longer term issues on which we are currently working to manage contracts and reinforcement learning efficiently in cloud controllers.},

In this article, a novel approach based on the Logic-Based Benders decomposition principle is introduced for mapping complex applications on these platforms, aiming at optimizing their execution time. To provide optimal solutions for this problem in a short time, a new hybrid model that combines Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Constraint Programming (CP) models is introduced. Also, to reduce the complexity of the model and its solution time, a set of novel techniques for generating additional constraints called Benders cuts is proposed. An extensive set of experiments has been performed in which synthetic applications described by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) were mapped to a number of heterogeneous multicore platforms. Moreover, experiments with DAGs that correspond to two real-life applications have also been performed. Based on the experimental results, it is proven that the proposed approach outperforms the pure ILP model in terms of the solution time and quality of the solution. Specifically, the proposed approach is able to find an optimal solution within a time limit of 2 hours in the vast majority of performed experiments, while the pure ILP model fails. Also, for the cases where both methods fail to find an optimal solution within the time limit, the solution of the proposed approach is systematically better than the solution of the ILP model.},

  abstract = {In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Clouds, users are charged to utilize cloud services according to a pay-per-use model. If users intend to run their workflow applications on cloud resources within a specific budget, they have to adjust their demands for cloud resources with respect to this budget. Although several scheduling approaches have introduced solutions to optimize the makespan of workflows on a set of heterogeneous IaaS cloud resources within a certain budget, the hourly-based cost model of some well-known cloud providers (e.g., Amazon EC2 Cloud) can easily lead to a higher makespan and some schedulers may not find any feasible solution. In this article, we propose a novel resource provisioning mechanism and a workflow scheduling algorithm, named Greedy Resource Provisioning and modified HEFT (GRP-HEFT), for minimizing the makespan of a given workflow subject to a budget constraint for the hourly-based cost model of modern IaaS clouds. As a resource provisioning mechanism, we propose a greedy algorithm which lists the instance types according to their efficiency rate. For our scheduler, we modified the HEFT algorithm to consider a budget limit. GRP-HEFT is compared against state-of-the-art workflow scheduling techniques, including MOACS (MultiObjective Ant Colony System), PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), and GA (Genetic Algorithm). The experimental results demonstrate that GRP-HEFT outperforms GA, PSO, and MOACS for several well-known scientific workflow applications for different problem sizes on average by 13.64, 19.77, and 11.69 percent, respectively. Also in terms of time complexity, GRP-HEFT outperforms GA, PSO and MOACS.},

We analyze and classify different objectives with respect to their impact on the optimization process and present a four-objective case study comprising make span, economic cost, energy consumption, and reliability. We implemented the algorithm as part of the ASKALON environment for Grid and Cloud computing. Results for two real-world applications demonstrate that the solutions generated by our algorithm are superior to user-defined constraints most of the time.

  abstract = {Executing large-scale applications in distributed computing infrastructures (DCI), for example modern Cloud environments, involves optimization of several conflicting objectives such as makespan, reliability, energy, or economic cost. Despite this trend, scheduling in heterogeneous DCIs has been traditionally approached as a single or bi-criteria optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a generic multi-objective optimization framework supported by a list scheduling heuristic for scientific workflows in heterogeneous DCIs. The algorithm approximates the optimal solution by considering user-specified constraints on objectives in a dual strategy: maximizing the distance to the user's constraints for dominant solutions and minimizing it otherwise. We instantiate the framework and algorithm for a four-objective case study comprising makespan, economic cost, energy consumption, and reliability as optimization goals. We implemented our method as part of the ASKALON environment (Fahringer et~al., 2007) for Grid and Cloud computing and demonstrate through extensive real and synthetic simulation experiments that our algorithm outperforms related bi-criteria heuristics while meeting the user constraints most of the time.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic framework for day-ahead scheduling of microgrid energy storage systems in the context of multi-objective (MO) optimization. Operation cost of microgrid in normal conditions and load curtailment index in case of unscheduled islanding events (initiated by disturbances in the main grid) are chosen as main criteria of the proposed scheme. In practice, duration of disconnection from the upstream network is unknown in unscheduled islanding incidents and cannot be predicted with certainty. To properly handle the uncertainties associated with time and duration of such events as well as microgrid load and renewable power generation, stochastic models are involved in the MO scheduling framework and they are formulated as mixed integer linear programming problems. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is employed to effectively cope with the MO optimization problem and a fuzzy decision making approach is employed for appropriate representation of microgrid operator's preferences in compromising between the two objectives. The proposed scheme is implemented on a test microgrid and the obtained results demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of this framework in dealing with conflicting requirements of microgrid security and economic operation.},

  abstract = {Automation of the execution of computational tasks is at the heart of improving scientific productivity. Over the last years, scientific workflows have been established as an important abstraction that captures data processing and computation of large and complex scientific applications. By allowing scientists to model and express entire data processing steps and their dependencies, workflow management systems relieve scientists from the details of an application and manage its execution on a computational infrastructure. As the resource requirements of today's computational and data science applications that process vast amounts of data keep increasing, there is a compelling case for a new generation of advances in high-performance computing, commonly termed as extreme-scale computing, which will bring forth multiple challenges for the design of workflow applications and management systems. This paper presents a novel characterization of workflow management systems using features commonly associated with extreme-scale computing applications. We classify 15 popular workflow management systems in terms of workflow execution models, heterogeneous computing environments, and data access methods. The paper also surveys workflow applications and identifies gaps for future research on the road to extreme-scale workflows and management systems.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are very popular these days, and are the subject of a very intense investigation. A DNN is made up of layers of internal units (or neurons), each of which computes an affine combination of the output of the units in the previous layer, applies a nonlinear operator, and outputs the corresponding value (also known as activation). A commonly-used nonlinear operator is the so-called rectified linear unit (ReLU), whose output is just the maximum between its input value and zero. In this (and other similar cases like max pooling, where the max operation involves more than one input value), for fixed parameters one can model the DNN as a 0-1 Mixed Integer Linear Program (0-1 MILP) where the continuous variables correspond to the output values of each unit, and a binary variable is associated with each ReLU to model its yes/no nature. In this paper we discuss the peculiarity of this kind of 0-1 MILP models, and describe an effective boundtightening technique intended to ease its solution. We also present possible applications of the 0-1 MILP model arising in feature visualization and in the construction of adversarial examples. Computational results are reported, aimed at investigating (on small DNNs) the computational performance of a state-of-the-art MILP solver when applied to a known test case, namely, hand-written digit recognition.},

We propose the Globus Architecture for Reservation and Allocation (GARA) to address these four issues. GARA treats both reservations and computational elements such as processes, network flows, and memory blocks as first class entities, allowing them to be created, monitored, and managed independently and uniformly. It simplifies management of heterogeneous resource types by defining uniform mechanisms for computers, networks, disk, memory, and other resources. Layering on these standard mechanisms, GARA enables the construction of application-level co-reservation and coallocation libraries that applications can use to dynamically assemble collections of resources, guided by both application QoS requirements and the local administration policy of individual resources. We describe a prototype GARA implementation that supports three different resource types\textemdash parallel computers, individual CPUs under control of the Dynamic Soft Real-Time scheduler, and Integrated Services networks\textemdash and provide performance results that quantify the costs of our techniques.},

Due to the lack of centralized control and the dynamic/stochastic nature of resource availability, any successful allocation mechanism should be highly distributed and robust to the changes in the Grid environment. Moreover, it is desirable to have an allocation mechanism that does not rely on the availability of coherent global information. In this paper we examine a simple algorithm for distributed resource allocation in a simplified Grid-like environment that meets the above requirements. Our system consists of a large number of heterogenous reinforcement learning agents that share common resources for their computational needs. There is no explicit communication or interaction between the agents: the only information that agents receive is the expected response time of a job it submitted to a particular resource, which serves as a reinforcement signal for the agent. The results of our experiments suggest that even simple reinforcement learning can indeed be used to achieve load balanced resource allocation in large scale heterogenous system.},

Results. Our scheduling simulations produce plans that use about 99\% of the available telescope time (including overheads) and optimally distribute the observations among the different targets. Under such conditions, and using current planet statistics, the optimized plan using this tool should allow the CARMENES survey to discover about 65\% of the planets with radial-velocity semi-amplitudes greater than 1 m s-1 when considering only photon noise.
Conclusions. The simulations using our scheduling tool show that it is possible to optimize the survey planning by minimizing idle instrument periods and fulfilling the science objectives in an efficient manner to maximize the scientific return.},

CPS also have stringent requirements on real-time operation and safety that are fulfilled by rigorous model design and verification. In the real-time literature, adaptation is mostly limited to off-line modeling of predicted system transitions. In the adaptive systems literature, adaptation solutions are silent about timely execution and about the underlying hardware possibilities that can potentially speed up execution. This paper presents a solution for designing adaptive cyber-physical systems by using parametric models that are verified during the system execution (i.e., online), so that adaptation decisions are made based on the timing requirements of each particular adaptation event. Our approach allows the system to undergo timely adaptations that exploit the potential parallelism of the software and its execution over multicore processors. We exemplify the approach on a specific use case with autonomous vehicles communication, showing its applicability for situations that require time-bounded online adaptations.},

The disruption handling process can be partitioned into three phases resembling a bathtub. For each phase the essential decision making process has been identified. Currently, the support to rail traffic controllers in case of severe disruptions is limited to predefined contingency plans that are not always feasible or applicable. In the literature, models and algorithms have been identified that could be used in the different parts of the three phases of the disruption handling process. This paper investigates the processes of disruption management in practice and the challenges that traffic controllers are facing during a disruption. The literature of models applicable to disruption management is reviewed and classified based on the three phases of the traffic state during disruptions. Finally, a rescheduling optimization model is applied to a case of complete blockage on a corridor of the Dutch railway network. The case study shows how a microscopic model could support the traffic controllers by providing real-time solutions for different phases of a disruption.},

  abstract = {In cloud computing environment, resources can be dynamically provisioned on deman for cloud services The amount of the resources to be provisioned is determined during runtime according to the workload changes. Deciding the right amount of resources required to run the cloud services is not trivial, and it depends on the current workload of the cloud services. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the future demands to automatically provision resources in order to deal with fluctuating demands of the cloud services. In this paper, we propose a hybrid resource provisioning approach for cloud services that is based on a combination of the concept of the autonomic computing and the reinforcement learning (RL). Also, we present a framework for autonomic resource provisioning which is inspired by the cloud layer model. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach under two real world workload traces. The experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces the total cost by up to 50\%, and increases the resource utilization by up to 12\% compared with the other approaches.},

Scheduling efficiency can be seen as the problem of minimizing the overall execution time (makespan) of the set of tasks under question. This problem is known to be NP-hard and is currently addressed using heuristics, evolutionary algorithms and other optimization methods. In this paper, firstly, two novel fast executing heuristics, called LSufferage and TPB, are introduced. L(ist)Sufferage is based on the known heuristic Sufferage and can achieve in general better results than it for most of the cases. T(enacious)PB is also based on another heuristic (Penalty Based) and incorporates new ideas that significantly improve the quality of the resulted schedule. Secondly, a mathematical model of the problem is presented alongside with an associated approach based on the Linear Programming method of Column Pricing. This approach, which is called Column Pricing with Restarts (CPR), can be categorized as a hybrid mathematical programming and heuristic approach and is capable of solving in reasonable time problem instances of practically any size. Experiments show that CPR achieves superior results improving over published results on problem instances of various sizes. Moreover, hardware requirements of CPR are minimal.},

AI approaches encompass a rich collection of knowledge representation formalisms for dealing with a wide variety of real-world problems. Some examples are constraint programming representations, logical formalisms, declarative and functional programming languages such as Prolog and Lisp, Bayesian models, rule-based formalism, etc. The downside of such rich representations is that in general they lead to intractable problems, and we therefore often cannot use such formalisms for handling realistic size problems. OR, on the other hand, has focused on more tractable representations, such as linear programming formulations. OR-based techniques have demonstrated the ability to identify optimal and locally optimal solutions for well-defined problem spaces. In general, however, OR solutions are restricted to rigid models with limited expressive power. AI techniques, on the other hand, provide richer and more flexible representations of real-world problems, supporting efficient constraint-based reasoning mechanisms as well as mixed initiative frameworks, which allow the human expertise to be in the loop. The challenge lies in providing representations that are expressive enough to describe real-world problems and at the same time guaranteeing good and fast solutions.},

As patient's length of stay in waiting lists increases, governments are looking for strategies to control the problem. Agreements were created with private providers to diminish the workload in the public sector. However, the growth of the private sector is not following the demand for care. Given this context, new management strategies have to be considered in order to minimize patient length of stay in waiting lists while reducing the costs and increasing (or at least maintaining) the quality of care.
Method
Appointment scheduling systems are today known to be proficient in the optimization of health care services. Their utilization is focused on increasing the usage of human resources, medical equipment and reducing the patient waiting times. In this paper, a simulation-based optimization approach to the Patient Admission Scheduling Problem is presented. Modeling tools and simulation techniques are used in the optimization of a diagnostic imaging department.
Results
The proposed techniques have demonstrated to be effective in the evaluation of diagnostic imaging workflows. A simulated annealing algorithm was used to optimize the patient admission sequence towards minimizing the total completion and total waiting of patients. The obtained results showed average reductions of 5\% on the total completion and 38\% on the patients' total waiting time.},

We present an evaluation of our mapping on a hyperthreaded Intel Pentium 4 CPU as a canonical example of a general-purpose processor. We compare the mapped stream program against the same program coded in a more conventional style for the general-purpose processor. Using both micro-benchmarks and scientific applications we show that programs written in a streaming style can run comparably to equivalent programs written in a traditional style. Our results show that coding programs in a streaming style can improve performance on today\textquestiondown s machines and smooth the way for significant performance improvements with the deployment of streaming architectures.},

  abstract = {We introduce MiningZinc, a declarative framework for constraint-based data mining. MiningZinc consists of two key components: a language component and an execution mechanism. First, the MiningZinc language allows for high-level and natural modeling of mining problems, so that MiningZinc models are similar to the mathematical definitions used in the literature. It is inspired by the Zinc family of languages and systems and supports user-defined constraints and functions. Secondly, the MiningZinc execution mechanism specifies how to compute solutions for the models. It is solver independent and supports both standard constraint solvers and specialized data mining systems. The high-level problem specification is first translated into a normalized constraint language (FlatZinc). Rewrite rules are then used to add redundant constraints or solve subproblems using specialized data mining algorithms or generic constraint programming solvers. Given a model, different execution strategies are automatically extracted that correspond to different sequences of algorithms to run. Optimized data mining algorithms, specialized processing routines and generic solvers can all be automatically combined. Thus, the MiningZinc language allows one to model constraint-based itemset mining problems in a solver independent way, and its execution mechanism can automatically chain different algorithms and solvers. This leads to a unique combination of declarative modeling with high-performance solving.},

With cloud as an additional deployment option, HPC users and providers are faced with the challenges of dealing with highly heterogeneous resources, where the variability spans across a wide range of processor configurations, interconnects, virtualization environments, and pricing models. In this paper, we take a holistic viewpoint to answer the question-why and whoshould choose cloud for HPC, for what applications, and how should cloud be used for HPC? To this end, we perform comprehensive performance and cost evaluation and analysis of running a set of HPC applications on a range of platforms, varying from supercomputers to clouds. Further, we improve performance of HPC applications in cloud by optimizing HPC applications' characteristics for cloud and cloud virtualization mechanisms for HPC. Finally, we present novel heuristics for online application-aware job scheduling in multi-platform environments. Experimental results and simulations using CloudSim show that current clouds cannot substitute supercomputers but can effectively complement them. Significant improvement in average turnaround time (up to 2X)and throughput (up to 6X) can be attained using our intelligent application-aware dynamic scheduling heuristics compared tosingle-platform or application-agnostic scheduling.},

Despite the implicit parallelism of population-based search, no attempt has yet been made to multitask, i.e., to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously using a single population of evolving individuals. Accordingly, this paper introduces evolutionary multitasking as a new paradigm in the field of optimization and evolutionary computation. We first formalize the concept of evolutionary multitasking and then propose an algorithm to handle such problems. The methodology is inspired by biocultural models of multifactorial inheritance, which explain the transmission of complex developmental traits to offspring through the interactions of genetic and cultural factors. Furthermore, we develop a cross-domain optimization platform that allows one to solve diverse problems concurrently. The numerical experiments reveal several potential advantages of implicit genetic transfer in a multitasking environment. Most notably, we discover that the creation and transfer of refined genetic material can often lead to accelerated convergence for a variety of complex optimization functions.},

Nevertheless, the new challenging topic is that the scheduling of these scientific workflows in the LSDS is a well-known NP-hard problem. The goal of this work is to design an Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm Version II (NSGA-II)-based approach for optimizing a multi objective scheduling of scientific workflows in hybrid distributed systems.

Parallel I/O is a significant bottleneck in HPC applications, and is especially challenging in Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) applications because the structure of output files changes dynamically during runtime. Data-intensive AMR applications run on the Cori supercomputer at NERSC show variable and often poor I/O performance, but diagnosing the root cause remains challenging. Here we analyze logs from multiple levels of Cori's parallel I/O subsystems, and find bottlenecks during file metadata operations and during the writing of file contents that reduced I/O bandwidth by up to 40x. Such bottlenecks seemed to be system-dependent and not the fault of the application. Increasing the granularity of file-system performance data will help provide conclusive causal relationships between file-system servers and metadata bottlenecks.},

The third decomposes the problem into a portion solved by CP and a portion solved by OR, using CP-based column generation or logic-based Benders decomposition. The fourth uses relaxed decision diagrams developed for CP propagation to help solve dynamic programming models in OR. The paper cites a significant fraction of the literature on CP/OR integration and concludes with future perspectives.},

  abstract = {The emerging connected-vehicle technology provides a new dimension for developing more intelligent traffic control algorithms for signalized intersections. An important challenge for scheduling in networked transportation systems is the switchover delay caused by the guard time before any traffic signal change. The switch-over delay can result in significant loss of system capacity and hence needs to be accommodated in the scheduling design. To tackle this challenge, we propose a distributed online scheduling policy that extends the well-known Max-Pressure policy to address switch-over delay by introducing a bias factor favoring the current schedule. We prove that the proposed policy is throughput-optimal with switch-over delay. Furthermore, the proposed policy remains optimal when there are both connected signalized intersections and conventional fixed-time ones in the system. With connected-vehicle technology, the proposed policy can be easily incorporated into the current transportation systems without additional infrastructure. Through extensive simulation in VISSIM, we show that our policy indeed outperforms the existing popular policies.},

A performance model with two interactive job classes is used to determine the smallest number of servers required to meet the SLAs of both classes. For each class, the SLA is specified by the relationship: Prob [response time {$\leq$} x] {$\geq$} y. Two server allocation strategies are considered: shared allocation (SA) and dedicated allocation (DA). For the case of FCFS scheduling, analytic results for response time distribution are used to develop a heuristic algorithm that determines an allocation strategy (SA or DA) that requires the smallest number of servers. The effectiveness of this algorithm is evaluated over a range of operating conditions. The performance of SA with non-FCFS scheduling is also investigated. Among the scheduling disciplines considered, a new discipline called probability dependent priority is found to have the best performance in terms of requiring the smallest number of servers.},

Secondly, personal-best archives (cognitive memories) and global-best archive (social memory), which are updated by the predefined non-dominated archive update strategy, are simultaneously designed to preserve non-dominated individuals and select personal-best positions and the global-best position.

  abstract = {The Grid scheduler, schedules user jobs on the best available resource in terms of resource characteristics by optimizing job execution time. Resource failure in Grid is no longer an exception but a regular occurring event as resources are increasingly being used by the scientific community to solve computationally intensive problems which typically run for days or even months. It is therefore absolutely essential that these long-running applications are able to tolerate failures and avoid re-computations from scratch after resource failure has occurred, to satisfy the user's Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. Job Scheduling with Fault Tolerance in Grid Computing using Ant Colony Optimization is proposed to ensure that jobs are executed successfully even when resource failure has occurred. The technique employed in this paper, is the use of resource failure rate, as well as checkpoint-based roll back recovery strategy. Check-pointing aims at reducing the amount of work that is lost upon failure of the system by immediately saving the state of the system. A comparison of the proposed approach with an existing Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is discussed. The experimental results of the implemented Fault Tolerance scheduling algorithm show that there is an improvement in the user's QoS requirement over the existing ACO algorithm, which has no fault tolerance integrated in it. The performance evaluation of the two algorithms was measured in terms of the three main scheduling performance metrics: makespan, throughput and average turnaround time.},

Some of these stages are performed consecutively, and the others are carried out in parallel on clusters, grids, and cloud.

This paper proposed a tuple molecular structure-based chemical reaction optimization (TMSCRO) method for DAG scheduling on heterogeneous computing systems, based on a very recently proposed metaheuristic method, chemical reaction optimization (CRO). Comparing with other CRO-based algorithms for DAG scheduling, the design of tuple reaction molecular structure and four elementary reaction operators of TMSCRO is more reasonable. TMSCRO also applies the concept of constrained critical paths (CCPs), constrained-critical-path directed acyclic graph (CCPDAG) and super molecule for accelerating convergence.

However, the efficacy of most, if not all, of these previous works is limited by the original design and structure of workflow, i.e., Sequential code and few bottleneck tasks. In this paper, we address the optimization of scientific workflow execution in clouds by exploiting multi-core systems with the parallelization of bottleneck tasks. To this end, we develop a workflow visualization toolkit to synthetize resource consumption and data transfer patterns, as well as to identify the bottleneck, of the workflow being studied. Parallelization techniques are then applied to the module that is identified as the bottleneck in order to take full advantage of the underlying multicore computing environment. Testing results with a 6.0-degree Montage example on Amazon EC2 with various configurations show that our optimization of workflows (bottleneck tasks in particular) reduces completion time (or make span) by 21\% to 43\% depending on the instance type being used to run the workflow, without any impact on the cost.},

A recently proposed metaheuristic method, Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO), demonstrates its capability for solving NP-complete optimization problems. This paper develops an algorithm named Double-Reaction-Structured Chemical Reaction Optimization (DRSCRO) for DAG scheduling on heterogeneous systems, which modifies the conventional CRO framework and incorporates CRO with the variable neighborhood search (VNS) method. DRSCRO has two reaction phases for super molecule selection and global optimization, respectively. In the molecule selection phase, the CRO as a metaheuristic algorithm is adopted to obtain a super molecule for accelerating convergence. For promoting the intensification capability, in the global optimization phase, the VNS algorithm with a new processor selection model is used as the initialization under the consideration of scheduling order and processor assignment, and the load balance neighborhood structure of VNS is also utilized in the ineffective reaction operator. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of DRSCRO in terms of makespan and convergence rate.},

CS is known as an efficient scheduling method that can assign different time fractions for users or, equivalently, satisfy different channel access ratio (CAR) requirements of users while exploiting multiuser diversity. We first mathematically analyze the throughput characteristics of CS in arbitrary fading statistics and data rate functions. It is shown that the throughput gain of CS increases as the CAR of a user decreases or the number of users in a cell increases. For Nakagami-m fading channels, we obtain the average throughput in closed form and investigate the effects of the average signal-to-noise ratio, the shape parameter m, and the CAR on the throughput performance. In addition, we propose a threshold-based opportunistic feedback technique in order to reduce feedback overhead while satisfying the CAR requirements of users. We prove that the average feedback overhead of the proposed technique is upper-bounded by -lnp, where p is the probability that no user satisfies the threshold condition in a cell. Finally, we adopt a novel fairness criterion, called qualitative fairness, which considers not only the quantity of the allocated resources to users, but also the quality of the resources. It is observed that CS provides a better qualitative fairness than other scheduling algorithms designed for controlling CARs of users.},

The limited performance of simulators even of moderate size and detail makes the approach infeasible for design-space exploration of future exascale systems. Analytic models, in contrast, offer very fast turn-around times. In this paper we propose an analytic multi-core processor-performance model that takes as inputs a) a parametric microarchitecture-independent characterization of the target workload, and b) a hardware configuration of the core and the memory hierarchy. The processor-performance model considers instruction-level parallelism (ILP) per type, models single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) features, and considers cache and memory-bandwidth contention between cores. We validate our model by comparing its performance estimates with measurements from hardware performance counters on Intel Xeon and ARM Cortex-A15 systems. We estimate multi-core contention with a maximum error of 11.4 percent. The average single-thread error increases from 25 percent for a state-of-the-art simulator to 59 percent for our model, but the correlation is still 0.8, a high relative accuracy, while we achieve a speedup of several orders of magnitude. With a much higher capacity than simulators and more reliable insights than back-of-the-envelope calculations it makes automated design-space exploration of exascale systems possible, which we show using a real-world case study from radio astronomy.},

  abstract = {In system-level design, applications are represented as task graphs where tasks (called nodes) have moderate to large granularity and each node has several implementation options differing in area and execution time. We define the extended partitioning problem as the joint determination of the mapping (hardware or software), the implementation option (called implementation bin), as well as the schedule, for each node, so that the overall area allocated to nodes in hardware is minimum and a deadline constraint is met. This problem is considerably harder (and richer) than the traditional binary partitioning problem that determines just the best mapping and schedule. Both binary and extended partitioning problems are constrained optimization problems and are NP-hard.We first present an efficient(O(N2)) heuristic, called GCLP, to solve the binary partitioning problem. The heuristic reduces the greediness associated with traditional list-scheduling algorithms by formulating a global measure, called global criticality (GC). The GC measure also permits an adaptive selection of the optimization objective at each step of the algorithm; since the optimization problem is constrained by a deadline, either area or time is optimized at a given step based on the value of GC. The selected objective is used to determine the mapping of nodes that are ``normal'', i.e. nodes that do not exhibit affinity for a particular mapping. To account for nodes that are not ``normal'', we define ``extremities'' and ``repellers''. Extremities consume disproportionate amounts of resources in hardware and software. Repellers are inherently unsuitable to either hardware or software based on certain structural properties. The mapping of extremities and repellers is determined jointly by GC and their local preference.We then present an efficient ( O(N3 + N2B), for N nodes and B bins per node) heuristic for extended partitioning, called MIBS, that alternately uses GCLP and an implementation-bin selection procedure. The implementation-bin selection procedure chooses, for a node with already determined mapping, an implementation bin that maximizes the area-reduction gradient of as-yet unmapped nodes. Solutions generated by both heuristics are shown to be reasonably close to optimal. Extended partitioning generates considerably smaller overall hardware as compared to binary partitioning.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing has become a buzzword in the area of high performance distributed computing as it provides on-demand access to shared pool of resources over Internet in a self-service, dynamically scalable and metered manner. Cloud computing is still in its infancy, so to reap its full benefits, much research is required across a broad array of topics. One of the important research issues which need to be focused for its efficient performance is scheduling. The goal of scheduling is to map tasks to appropriate resources that optimize one or more objectives. Scheduling in cloud computing belongs to a category of problems known as NP-hard problem due to large solution space and thus it takes a long time to find an optimal solution. There are no algorithms which may produce optimal solution within polynomial time to solve these problems. In cloud environment, it is preferable to find suboptimal solution, but in short period of time. Metaheuristic based techniques have been proved to achieve near optimal solutions within reasonable time for such problems. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey and comparative analysis of various scheduling algorithms for cloud and grid environments based on three popular metaheuristic techniques: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and two novel techniques: League Championship Algorithm (LCA) and BAT algorithm.},

Due to the large state space, a function approximator, based on a neural network, is used to model the long-term reward function. The schedules generated by the trained agent are compared to those produced by a deterministic heuristic control policy that has been developed for this assembly plant. Simulation results show that the reinforcement learning agent produces production plans that achieve better productivity than the heuristic controller under tight planning horizons, generating sub-optimal yet acceptable production mix balance.},

  abstract = {The design of strategies for branching in Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) is guided by cycles of parameter tuning and offline experimentation on an extremely heterogeneous testbed, using the average performance. Once devised, these strategies (and their parameter settings) are essentially input-agnostic. To address these issues, we propose a machine learning (ML) framework for variable branching in MIP. Our method observes the decisions made by Strong Branching (SB), a time-consuming strategy that produces small search trees, collecting features that characterize the candidate branching variables at each node of the tree. Based on the collected data, we learn an easy-to-evaluate surrogate function that mimics the SB strategy, by means of solving a learning-to-rank problem, common in ML. The learned ranking function is then used for branching. The learning is instance-specific, and is performed on-the-fly while executing a branch-and-bound search to solve the instance. Experiments on benchmark instances indicate that our method produces significantly smaller search trees than existing heuristics, and is competitive with a state-of-the-art commercial solver.},

  abstract = {Primal heuristics'' are a key contributor to the improved performance of exact branch-and-bound solvers for combinatorial optimization and integer programming. Perhaps the most crucial question concerning primal heuristics is that of at which nodes they should run, to which the typical answer is via hard-coded rules or fixed solver parameters tuned, offline, by trial-and-error. Alternatively, a heuristic should be run when it is most likely to succeed, based on the problem instance's characteristics, the state of the search, etc. In this work, we study the problem of deciding at which node a heuristic should be run, such that the overall (primal) performance of the solver is optimized. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at formalizing and systematically addressing this problem. Central to our approach is the use of Machine Learning (ML) for predicting whether a heuristic will succeed at a given node. We give a theoretical framework for analyzing this decision-making process in a simplified setting, propose a ML approach for modeling heuristic success likelihood, and design practical rules that leverage the ML models to dynamically decide whether to run a heuristic at each node of the search tree. Experimentally, our approach improves the primal performance of a stateof-the-art Mixed Integer Programming solver by up to 6\% on a set of benchmark instances, and by up to 60\% on a family of hard Independent Set instances.},

Many workflow management systems (WMS) exist that undertake the task of scheduling workflows across distributed computational resources. In this work, we introduce a WMS that leverages machine learning to predict workflow task runtime and the probability of failure of task assignments to execution sites. The expected runtime of workflow tasks can be used to approximate the weight of the workflow graph branches in respect to the total workflow workload and the ability to anticipate task failures can discourage task assignments that are unlikely to succeed. We demonstrate that the proposed machine learning models can lead to significantly more informed scheduling decisions that minimize task failures and utilize execution sites more efficiently, thus leading to reduced workflow runtime. Additionally, we train a modified sequence-to-sequence neural network architecture via reinforcement learning to perform scheduling decisions as part of a WMS. Our approach introduces a WMS that can drastically improve its scheduling performance by independently learning over time, without external intervention or reliance on any specific heuristic or optimization technique. Finally, we test our approach in real-world scenarios utilizing computationally demanding and data intensive workflows and evaluate its performance against existing scheduling methodologies traditionally used in WMSes. The performance evaluation outcome confirms that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the other scheduling algorithms in a consistent manner and achieves the best execution runtime with the lowest number of failed tasks and communication costs.},

So task scheduling which is one of the NP-Complete problems becomes a focus of research scholars in grid computing area. The traditional Min-Min algorithm is a simple algorithm that produces a schedule that minimizes the makespan than the other traditional algorithms in the literature.

  abstract = {Model-free and model-based reinforcement learning have provided a successful framework for understanding both human behavior and neural data. These two systems are usually thought to compete for control of behavior. However, it has also been proposed that they can be integrated in a cooperative manner. For example, the Dyna algorithm uses model-based replay of past experience to train the model-free system, and has inspired research examining whether human learners do something similar. Here we introduce an approach that links model-free and model-based learning in a new way: via the reward function. Given a model of the learning environment, dynamic programming is used to iteratively estimate state values that monotonically converge to the state values under the optimal decision policy. Pseudorewards are calculated from these values and used to shape the reward function of a model-free learner in a way that is guaranteed not to change the optimal policy. In two experiments we show that this method offers computational advantages over Dyna. It also offers a new way to think about integrating model-free and model-based reinforcement learning: that our knowledge of the world doesn't just provide a source of simulated experience for training our instincts, but that it shapes the rewards that those instincts latch onto.},

The key objective is to understand how the various algorithms in the NLopt library perform in combination with the Multi Trajectory Local Search (Mtsls1) technique. A hybrid approach has been introduced in the local search strategy by the use of a parameter which allows for probabilistic selection between Mtsls1 and a NLopt algorithm. In case of stagnation, the algorithm switch is made based on the algorithm being used in the previous iteration. The paper presents an exhaustive comparison on the performance of these approaches on Soft Computing (SOCO) and Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2014 benchmarks. For both benchmarks, we conclude that the best performing algorithm is a hybrid variant of Mtsls1 with BFGS for local search.},

  abstract = {The problem of scheduling a parallel program represented by a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) to a set of homogeneous processors for minimizing the completion time of the program has been extensively studied. The NP-completeness of the problem has stimulated researchers to propose a myriad of heuristic algorithms. While most of these algorithms are reported to be efficient, it is not clear how they compare against each other. A meaningful performance evaluation and comparison of these algorithms is a complex task and it must take into account a number of issues. First, most scheduling algorithms are based upon diverse assumptions, making the performance comparison rather meaningless. Second, there does not exist a standard set of benchmarks to examine these algorithms. Third, most algorithms are evaluated using small problem sizes, and, therefore, their scalability is unknown. In this paper, we first provide a taxonomy for classifying various algorithms into distinct categories according to their assumptions and functionalities. We then propose a set of benchmarks that are based on diverse structures and are not biased toward a particular scheduling technique. We have implemented 15 scheduling algorithms and compared them on a common platform by using the proposed benchmarks, as well as by varying important problem parameters. We interpret the results based upon the design philosophies and principles behind these algorithms, drawing inferences why some algorithms perform better than others. We also propose a performance measure called scheduling scalability (SS) that captures the collective effectiveness of a scheduling algorithm in terms of its solution quality, the number of processors used, and the running time.},

The objective of this survey is to describe various scheduling algorithms and their functionalities in a contrasting fashion as well as examine their relative merits in terms of performance and time-complexity. Since these algorithms are based on diverse assumptions, they differ in their functionalities, and hence are difficult to describe in a unified context. We propose a taxonomy that classifies these algorithms into different categories. We consider 27 scheduling algorithms, with each algorithm explained through an easy-to-understand description followed by an illustrative example to demonstrate its operation.

After transformation, a very simple cost function can be devised which makes the proposed algorithm more efficient than the Kernighan-Lin (K-L) algorithm (1970). The computing time per iteration of the algorithm is O(k\texttimes N2), where N is the number of nodes in the given graph. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the K-L algorithm both in the quality of solutions and in the elapsed time.

  abstract = {In order to overcome the limitation of traditional reinforcement learning techniques on the restricted dimensionality of state and action spaces, the recent breakthroughs of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in Alpha Go and playing Atari set a good example in handling large state and action spaces of complicated control problems. The DRL technique is comprised of an offline deep neural network (DNN) construction phase and an online deep Q-learning phase. In the offline phase, DNNs are utilized to derive the correlation between each state\textendash action pair of the system and its value function. In the online phase, a deep Q-learning technique is adopted based on the offline-trained DNN to derive the optimal action and meanwhile update the value estimates and the DNN. This paper is the first to provide a comprehensive study of applications of the DRL framework on cloud computing and residential smart grid systems along with efficient hardware implementations. Based on the introduction of the general DRL framework, we develop two applications, one for the cloud computing resource allocation problem and one for the residential smart grid user-end task scheduling problem. The former could achieve up to 54.1\% energy saving compared with baselines through automatically and dynamically distributing resources to servers. The latter achieves up to 22.77\% total energy cost reduction compared with the baseline algorithm. The DRL framework is mainly utilized for the complicated control problems and requires light-weight and low-power implementations in edge and portable systems. In order to achieve this goal, we develop the ultra-low-power implementation of the DRL framework using the stochastic computing technique, which has the potential of significantly enhancing the computation speed and reducing hardware footprint and therefore the power/energy consumption. The overall implementation is based on the effective stochastic computing-based implementations of approximate parallel counter-based inner product blocks and tanh activation functions. The stochastic computing-based implementation achieves only 57941.61 {$\mu$}m2 area and 6.30 mW power with 412.47 ns delay.},

Utilizing the necessary and sufficient characterization of the Pareto optimum, the problem is transformed into a set of constrained optimal control problems with a special structure. Employing the discrete version of Pontryagin's maximum principle, the necessary conditions for the existence of the Pareto solutions are derived. Under certain convex assumptions, it is shown that the necessary conditions are sufficient too. Next, the obtained results are extended to the linear-quadratic case. For a fixed initial state, the necessary conditions resulting from the maximum principle and the convexity condition on the cost functional provide the necessary and sufficient description of the well-posedness of the weighted sum optimal control problem. For an arbitrary initial state, the solvability of the related difference Riccati equation provides a sufficient condition under which the Pareto-efficient strategies are equivalent to the weighted sum optimal controls. In addition, all Pareto solutions are derived based on the solutions of a set of difference equations. Two examples show the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

For such workflows, it is important to maximize the overall throughput to provide good quality of service. However, most of the existing scheduling algorithms are designed for scheduling of a single complex scientific workflow instance and are not efficient enough for scheduling transaction-intensive workflows. To address this problem, we propose a throughput maximization strategy (TMS), which contains two specific algorithms for scheduling transaction-intensive workflows at the instance and task levels, respectively. The first algorithm called Opposite Average Load tries to maximize the overall throughput by pursuing the overall load balance at the instance level, whereas the second algorithm called Extended Min\textendash Min tries to further maximize the overall throughput at the task level by increasing the utilization rate of resources within each local autonomous group. The comparison and simulation performed on Swinburne Decentralized Workflow for Grid (SwinDeW-G), a peer-to-peer-based grid workflow environment, demonstrate that our strategy can improve the overall throughput significantly over existing scheduling algorithms when scheduling transaction-intensive workflows.

  abstract = {Automatic decision-making approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL), have been applied to (partially) solve the resource allocation problem adaptively in the cloud computing system. However, a complete cloud resource allocation framework exhibits high dimensions in state and action spaces, which prohibit the usefulness of traditional RL techniques. In addition, high power consumption has become one of the critical concerns in design and control of cloud computing systems, which degrades system reliability and increases cooling cost. An effective dynamic power management (DPM) policy should minimize power consumption while maintaining performance degradation within an acceptable level. Thus, a joint virtual machine (VM) resource allocation and power management framework is critical to the overall cloud computing system. Moreover, novel solution framework is necessary to address the even higher dimensions in state and action spaces.},

  abstract = {Modern scientific experimental facilities such as xray light sources increasingly require on-demand access to largescale computing for data analysis, for example to detect experimental errors or to select the next experiment. As the number of such facilities, the number of instruments at each facility, and the scale of computational demands all grow, the question arises as to how to meet these demands most efficiently and cost-effectively. A single computer per instrument is unlikely to be cost-effective because of low utilization and high operating costs. A single national compute facility, on the other hand, introduces a single point of failure and perhaps excessive communication costs. We introduce here methods for evaluating these and other potential design points, such as per-facility computer systems and a distributed multisite ``superfacility.'' We use the U.S. Department of Energy light sources as a use case and build a mixed-integer programming model and a customizable superfacility simulator to enable joint optimization of design choices and associated operational decisions. The methodology and tools provide new insights into design choices for on-demand computing facilities for real-time analysis of scientific experiment data. The simulator can also be used to support facility operations, for example by simulating the impact of events such as outages.},

They stem from sharing IO system resources across the processes of single largescale applications and/or multiple simultaneous programs causing internal and external interference, which in turn, causes substantial reductions in IO performance. This paper presents interference effects measurements for two different file systems at multiple supercomputing sites. These measurements motivate developing a 'managed' IO approach using adaptive algorithms varying the IO system workload based on current levels and use areas. An implementation of these methods deployed for the shared, general scratch storage system on Oak Ridge National Laboratory machines achieves higher overall performance and less variability in both a typical usage environment and with artificially introduced levels of 'noise'. The latter serving to clearly delineate and illustrate potential problems arising from shared system usage and the advantages derived from actively managing it.},

  abstract = {Petascale science simulations generate 10s of TBs of application data per day, much of it devoted to their checkpoint/restart fault tolerance mechanisms. Previous work demonstrated the importance of carefully managing such output to prevent application slowdown due to IO blocking, resource contention negatively impacting simulation performance and to fully exploit the IO bandwidth available to the petascale machine. This paper takes a further step in understanding and managing extreme-scale IO. Specifically, its evaluations seek to understand how to efficiently read data for subsequent data analysis, visualization, checkpoint restart after a failure, and other read-intensive operations. In their entirety, these actions support the 'end-to-end' needs of scientists enabling the scientific processes being undertaken. Contributions include the following. First, working with application scientists, we define 'read' benchmarks that capture the common read patterns used by analysis codes. Second, these read patterns are used to evaluate different IO techniques at scale to understand the effects of alternative data sizes and organizations in relation to the performance seen by end users. Third, defining the novel notion of a 'data district' to characterize how data is organized for reads, we experimentally compare the read performance seen with the ADIOS middleware's log-based BP format to that seen by the logically contiguous NetCDF or HDF5 formats commonly used by analysis tools. Measurements assess the performance seen across patterns and with different data sizes, organizations, and read process counts. Outcomes demonstrate that high end-to-end IO performance requires data organizations that offer flexibility in data layout and placement on parallel storage targets, including in ways that can make tradeoffs in the performance of data writes vs. reads.},

The shift in technology, particularly the scale of parallel file systems and the number of compute processes, prompted revisiting best practices for optimal IO performance. Among other efforts like PLFS, the project that led to ADIOS, the ADaptable IO System, was motivated by both the shift in technology and the historical requirement, for optimal IO performance, to change how simulations performed IO depending on the platform. To solve both issues, the ADIOS team, along with consultation with other leading IO experts, sought to build a new IO platform based on the assumptions inherent in the petascale hardware platforms. This paper helps inform the design of future IO platforms with a discussion of lessons learned as part of the process of designing and building ADIOS.},

  abstract = {Typically, graph structures are represented by one of three different matrices: the adjacency matrix, the unnormalised and the normalised graph Laplacian matrices. The spectral (eigenvalue) properties of these different matrices are compared. For each pair, the comparison is made by applying an affine transformation to one of them, which enables comparison whilst preserving certain key properties such as normalised eigengaps. Bounds are given on the eigenvalue differences thus found, which depend on the minimum and maximum degree of the graph. The monotonicity of the bounds and the structure of the graphs are related. The bounds on a real social network graph, and on three model graphs, are illustrated and analysed. The methodology is extended to provide bounds on normalised eigengap differences which again turn out to be in terms of the graph's degree extremes. It is found that if the degree extreme difference is large, different choices of representation matrix may give rise to disparate inference drawn from graph signal processing algorithms; smaller degree extreme differences result in consistent inference, whatever the choice of representation matrix. The different inference drawn from signal processing algorithms is visualised using the spectral clustering algorithm on the three representation matrices corresponding to a model graph and a real social network graph.},

We discuss, develop, and assess novel algorithms based on static and dynamic strategies for both task scheduling and resource provisioning. We perform the evaluation via simulation using a set of scientific workflow ensembles with a broad range of budget and deadline parameters, taking into account task granularity, uncertainties in task runtime estimations, provisioning delays, and failures. We find that the key factor determining the performance of an algorithm is its ability to decide which workflows in an ensemble to admit or reject for execution. Our results show that an admission procedure based on workflow structure and estimates of task runtimes can significantly improve the quality of solutions.},

Popular scheduling methods in the classic high performance computing centers cannot fit into perplexing constraints over the computation tasks due to evolving telescope management policies and a large number of users across the world. Aiming at using the SDP workflow to construct radio signal images, we propose a set of comprehensive strategies, Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization and Critical-path Aware Earliest Finish Time (EFT), to reduce the overall execution time on different laxity time scenarios. If the observation tasks are planned in well advance, GA, which optimizes the scheduling results through a heuristic manner, is verified to outperform Round Robin. But if observation tasks are issued in short notice, to reduce time consumption, Critical-path Aware EFT is implemented. It is partitioned into upper and lower level to be a hierarchical scheduler and this mechanism provides both coarse and fine grained scheduling which guarantees the communication within the scheduler. Implemented on the popular cloud computing simulator CloudSim with datasets of different scales, Critical-path Aware EFT proves to be an effective and extendable method.},

Current systems, however, use simple generalized heuristics and ignore workload structure, since developing and tuning a bespoke heuristic for each workload is infeasible.

Decima uses reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks to learn workload-specific scheduling algorithms without any human instruction beyond specifying a high-level objective such as minimizing average job completion time. Off-the-shelf RL techniques, however, cannot handle the complexity and scale of the scheduling problem. To build Decima, we had to develop new representations for jobs' dependency graphs, design scalable RL models, and invent new RL training methods for continuous job arrivals. Our prototype integration with Spark on a 25-node cluster shows that Decima outperforms several heuristics, including hand-tuned ones, by at least 21\%. Further experiments with an industrial production workload trace demonstrate that Decima delivers up to a 17\% reduction in average job completion time and scales to large clusters.},

Although there are a many tools for evaluating components of desktop and server architectures in detail, scalable modeling tools are noticeably missing. We describe BigHouse a simulation infrastructure for data center systems. Instead of simulating servers using detailed microarchitectural models, BigHouse raises the level of abstraction. Using a combination of queuing theory and stochastic modeling, BigHouse can simulate server systems in minutes rather than hours. BigHouse leverages statistical simulation techniques to limit simulation turnaround time to the minimum runtime needed for a desired accuracy. In this paper, we introduce BigHouse, describe its design, and present case studies for how it has already been applied to build and validate models of data center workloads and systems. Furthermore, we describe statistical techniques incorporated into BigHouse to accelerate and parallelize its simulations, and demonstrate its scalability to model large cluster systems while maintaining reasonable simulation time.},

A schedule-dependent setup time is defined as a setup time dependent on the assignment of resources to activities over time, when resources are, e.g., placed in different locations. In such a case, the time necessary to prepare the required resource for processing an activity depends not only on the sequence of activities but, more generally, on the locations in which successive activities are executed. Activities are non-preemptable, resources are renewable, and the objective is to minimize the project duration.

It has the ability to accumulate the power of geographically scattered and heterogeneous resources to form a cohesive resource for performing higher level computations. Today's multidimensional and multidomain applications need multiple resources with diverse characteristics, i.e. huge computational power, larger storage capacity, higher processing speed and quicker accessibility of data. In recent past, many Grid Systems emerged in the form of various projects to solve many real-world complex problems. The resources required for efficient and reliable execution of the applications should be selected in accordance with the application requirements. This may be possible by classifying the Grid resources based on their major characteristics. The distinction of various Grid Systems into different categories aims towards supporting resource selection process in accordance with the application requirements. This paper presents a review and the state-of-the-art classification of Grid Systems in the perspective of scheduling and selection. A sequence of Grid System classification is presented based on Application type, Functionality, Scale, and Scope, including a brief study on each type. Finally, concluding remarks provides an assessment of various Grid Systems with the help of information collected from different sources.},

  abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

Accordingly, this study addressed the problem of scientific workflow scheduling in multi-cloud settings under deadline constraint to minimize associated financial costs. To this end, we proposed integer linear programming models that can be solved in a reasonable time by available solvers. In a mathematical model, the objective of a problem and real and physical constraints or restrictions are formulated using exact mathematical functions. Such formulation enabled us to comprehensively understand the system under evaluation, consider secondary preferences and post-optimality analysis and apply useful revisions to inappropriately selected input data. We analyzed the treatment of optimal cost under variations in deadline and workflow size. As part of the post-optimality analysis, sensitivity analysis and deadline revision were implemented. Results indicated that our proposed approach outperforms previously developed methods in terms of financial cost reduction.},

Centralized job scheduling methods have some drawbacks, such as single point of failure and lack of scalability. Moreover, decentralized methods require a coordination mechanism with limited communications. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent approach to job scheduling in Grid, named Centralized Learning Distributed Scheduling (CLDS), by utilizing the reinforcement learning framework. The CLDS is a model free approach that uses the information of jobs and their completion time to estimate the efficiency of resources. In this method, there are a learner agent and several scheduler agents that perform the task of learning and job scheduling with the use of a coordination strategy that maintains the communication cost at a limited level. We evaluated the efficiency of the CLDS method by designing and performing a set of experiments on a simulated Grid system under different system scales and loads. The results show that the CLDS can effectively balance the load of system even in large scale and heavy loaded Grids, while maintains its adaptive performance and scalability.},

It presents a new scheduling approach, termed as 'Dynamic Genetic Algorithm for Real-Time Scheduling' (dGA-RTS). The significant feature of dGA-RTS is that it can handle dynamic as well as static scheduling of inter-dependent tasks for real-time systems. In parallel or distributed systems, the main aim of dynamic task scheduling is to allocate processors to a given set of tasks to execute them within optimized completion times without violating the task dependencies, if any. The dGA-RTS schedules the tasks in the waiting list when any new task arrives in the scheduler and minimizes the overall schedule length of the task set ensuring deadline compliance. We also illustrate an implementation technique to deal with synchronization problems in multi-processor systems. In order to exhibit the applicability of our approach, we perform experiments with suitable benchmark as well as synthetic test cases. Further, we conduct extensive simulations and compare the results with different performance metrics.

  abstract = {There is no standard modelling language for constraint programming (CP) problems. Most solvers have their own modelling language. This makes it difficult for modellers to experiment with different solvers for a problem.In this paper we present MiniZinc, a simple but expressive CP modelling language which is suitable for modelling problems for a range of solvers and provides a reasonable compromise between many design possibilities. Equally importantly, we also propose a low-level solver-input language called FlatZinc, and a straightforward translation from MiniZinc to FlatZinc that preserves all solver-supported global constraints. This lets a solver writer support MiniZinc with a minimum of effort\textemdash they only need to provide a simple FlatZinc front-end to their solver, and then combine it with an existing MiniZinc-to-FlatZinc translator. Such a front-end may then serve as a stepping stone towards a full MiniZinc implementation that is more tailored to the particular solver.A standard language for modelling CP problems will encourage experimentation with and comparisons between different solvers. Although MiniZinc is not perfect\textemdash no standard modelling language will be\textemdash we believe its simplicity, expressiveness, and ease of implementation make it a practical choice for a standard language.},

  abstract = {High Performance Computing (HPC) clouds are becoming an alternative to on-premise clusters for executing scientific applications and business analytics services. Most research efforts in HPC cloud aim to understand the cost-benefit of moving resource-intensive applications from on-premise environments to public cloud platforms. Industry trends show hybrid environments are the natural path to get the best of the on-premise and cloud resources---steady (and sensitive) workloads can run on on-premise resources and peak demand can leverage remote resources in a pay-as-you-go manner. Nevertheless, there are plenty of questions to be answered in HPC cloud, which range from how to extract the best performance of an unknown underlying platform to what services are essential to make its usage easier. Moreover, the discussion on the right pricing and contractual models to fit small and large users is relevant for the sustainability of HPC clouds. This paper brings a survey and taxonomy of efforts in HPC cloud and a vision on what we believe is ahead of us, including a set of research challenges that, once tackled, can help advance businesses and scientific discoveries. This becomes particularly relevant due to the fast increasing wave of new HPC applications coming from big data and artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {Graph partitioning is an important problem in computer science and is of NP-hard complexity. In practice it is usually solved using heuristics. In this article we introduce the use of graph partitioning to partition the workload of stream programs to optimise the throughput on heterogeneous distributed platforms. Existing graph partitioning heuristics are not adequate for this problem domain. In this article we present two new heuristics to capture the problem space of graph partitioning for stream programs to optimise throughput. The first algorithm is an adaptation of the well-known Kernighan-Lin algorithm, called KL-Adapted (KLA), which is relatively slow. As a second algorithm we have developed the Congestion Avoidance (CA) partitioning algorithm, which performs reconfiguration moves optimised to our problem type. We compare both KLA and CA with the generic meta-heuristic Simulated Annealing (SA). All three methods achieve similar throughput results for most cases, but with significant differences in calculation time. For small graphs KLA is faster than SA, but KLA is slower for larger graphs. CA on the other hand is always orders of magnitudes faster than both KLA and SA, even for large graphs. This makes CA potentially useful for re-partitioning of systems during runtime.},

On the other hand, clients are obligated to maintain Service Level Agreement (SLA) with their users. One approach to deal with this cost-performance trade-off is employing an auto-scaling system which automatically adjusts application's resources based on its load. In this paper we have proposed an auto-scaling system based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We have conducted an experiment on Amazon EC2 infrastructure to evaluate our model.

With the rise of social media applications and smart devices, the amount of digital data and the velocity at which it is produced have increased exponentially, determining the development of distributed system frameworks and platforms that increase productivity, consistency, fault-tolerance and security of parallel applications. The performance of such systems is mainly influenced by the architectural disposition and composition of the physical machines, the resource allocation and the scheduling of jobs and tasks. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the scheduling problem in distributed systems. The machine learning technique takes into consideration the heterogeneity of the nodes and their disposition within the grid, and the arrangement of tasks in a directed acyclic graph of dependencies, ultimately determining a scheduling policy for a better execution time. This paper also proposes a platform, in which the algorithm is implemented, that offers scheduling as a service to distributed systems.},

This makes Cloud computing a compelling technology that tackles the issues rising with the growing size and complexity of scientific applications, which are characterized by high variance in usage, large volume of data and high compute load, flash crowds, unpredictable load, and varying compute and storage requirements. In order to provide users an automated and scalable platform for hosting scientific workflow applications, while hiding the complexity of the underlying Cloud infrastructure, we present the design and implementation of a PaaS middleware solution along with resource provisioning techniques. We apply our PaaS solution to the data analysis pipeline of a physics application, a gravitational wave search, utilizing public Clouds. The system architecture, a load-balancing approach, and the system's behavior over varying loads are detailed. The performance evaluation on scalability and load-balancing characteristics of the automated PaaS middleware demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of the approach over existing monolithic approaches.},

A task can be sped up by assigning it to more than one core. Moreover, processing requirements of tasks are in a constant state of flux and some of the cores assigned to a task entering a low processing requirement phase can be transferred to a task entering high requirement phase, maximizing overall performance of the system. This scheduling problem of partial core reallocations can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic programming based scheduler. Dynamic programming is an inherently centralized algorithm that uses only one of the available cores for scheduling-related computations and hence is not scalable. In this work, we introduce a distributed scheduler that disburses all scheduling-related computations throughout the many-core allowing it to scale up. We prove that our proposed scheduler is optimal and hence converges to the same solution as the centralized optimal scheduler. Our simulations show that the proposed distributed scheduler can result in 1000x reduction in per-core processing overhead in comparison to the centralized scheduler and hence is more suited for scheduling on many-cores.},

We then review existing work on contingency scheduling and conditional scheduling and propose extensions to address the dynamic satellite scheduling problem.

Moreover the submodels are scalable enough to capture the flexibility of the cloud computing paradigm. By analyzing the submodels, where results are repeated to obtain sufficient accuracy, we design a novel task scheduling scheme based on reinforcement learning and queuing theory to optimize task scheduling under the resource constraints, and the state aggregation technologies is employed to accelerate the learning progress. Our results, on the one hand, demonstrate the efficiency of the task scheduling scheme and, on the other hand, reveal the relationship between the arrival rate, server rate, number of VMs and the number of buffer size.},

But the behaviours developed by agents in simulation are often specific to the characteristics of the simulator. Due to modeling error, strategies that are successful in simulation may not transfer to their real world counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple method to bridge this "reality gap". By randomizing the dynamics of the simulator during training, we are able to develop policies that are capable of adapting to very different dynamics, including ones that differ significantly from the dynamics on which the policies were trained. This adaptivity enables the policies to generalize to the dynamics of the real world without any training on the physical system. Our approach is demonstrated on an object pushing task using a robotic arm. Despite being trained exclusively in simulation, our policies are able to maintain a similar level of performance when deployed on a real robot, reliably moving an object to a desired location from random initial configurations. We explore the impact of various design decisions and show that the resulting policies are robust to significant calibration error.},

However, action-decision based on multiobjective evaluation may be beneficial in order to obtain a high quality level of play. This paper presents a multiobjective Monte Carlo tree search algorithm for planning and control in real-time game domains, those where the time budget to decide the next move to make is close to 40 ms. A comparison is made between the proposed algorithm, a single-objective version of Monte Carlo tree search and a rolling horizon implementation of nondominated sorting evolutionary algorithm II (NSGA-II). Two different benchmarks are employed, deep sea treasure (DST) and the multiobjective physical traveling salesman problem (MO-PTSP). Using the same heuristics on each game, the analysis is focused on how well the algorithms explore the search space. Results show that the algorithm proposed outperforms NSGA-II. Additionally, it is also shown that the algorithm is able to converge to different optimal solutions or the optimal Pareto front (if achieved during search).},

In recent years, Cloud computing is fast evolving as the target platform for such applications among researchers. Furthermore, new pricing models have been pioneered by Cloud providers that allow users to provision resources and to use them in an efficient manner with significant cost reductions. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm that schedules tasks on Cloud resources using two different pricing models (spot and on-demand instances) to reduce the cost of execution whilst meeting the workflow deadline.

Workflows are increasingly becoming prevalent in various distributed environments, such as clusters, grids, and clouds. These environments provide complex infrastructures that aid workflows in scaling and parallel execution of their components. However, they are prone to performance variations and different types of failures. Thus, workflow management systems need to be robust against performance variations and tolerant against failures. Numerous research studies have investigated fault-tolerant aspect of the workflow management system in different distributed systems. In this study, we analyze these efforts and provide an in-depth taxonomy of them. We present the ontology of faults and fault-tolerant techniques then position the existing workflow management systems with respect to the taxonomies and the techniques. In addition, we classify various failure models, metrics, tools, and support systems. Finally, we identify and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the current techniques and provide recommendations on future directions and open areas for the research community.},

  abstract = {Branch and bound is a well-known generic method for computing an optimal solution of a single-objective optimization problem. Based on the idea ``divide to conquer'', it consists in an implicit enumeration principle viewed as a tree search. Although the branch and bound was first suggested by Land and Doig (1960), the first complete algorithm introduced as a multi-objective branch and bound that we identified was proposed by Kiziltan and Yucaoglu (1983). Rather few multi-objective branch and bound algorithms have been proposed. This situation is not surprising as the contributions on the extensions of the components of branch and bound for multi-objective optimization are recent. For example, the concept of bound sets, which extends the classic notion of bounds, has been mentioned by Villarreal and Karwan (1981). But it was only developed for the first time in 2001 by Ehrgott and Gandibleux, and fully defined in 2007. This paper describes a state-of-the-art of multi-objective branch and bound, which reviews concepts, components and published algorithms. It mainly focuses on the contributions belonging to the class of optimization problems who has received the most of attention in this context from 1983 until 2015: the linear optimization problems with zero-one variables and mixed 0\textendash 1/continuous variables. Only papers aiming to compute a complete set of efficient solutions are discussed.},

When the number of waiting requests reaches or exceeds the threshold N, sleeping VMs will resume processing requests independently after their corresponding sleep timers expire.

Software-defined networking (SDN) has been used in smart grid for real-time monitoring and communicating, which requires steady web-environment with no packet loss and less time delay. With the explosion of network scales, the idea of multiple controllers has been proposed, where the problem of load scheduling needs to be solved. However, some traditional load scheduling algorithms have inferior robustness under the complicated environments in smart grid, and inferior time efficiency without pre-strategy, which are hard to meet the requirement of smart grid. Therefore, we present a novel controller mind (CM) framework to implement automatic management among multiple controllers. Specially, in order to solve the problem of complexity and pre-strategy in the system, we propose a novel Quality of Service (QoS) enabled load scheduling algorithm based on reinforcement learning in this paper. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in the aspects of load variation and time efficiency.},

In this paper, we first define the workflow scheduling problem and describe the existing heuristic-based and metaheuristic-based workflow scheduling strategies in grids.

Using simulation, we compared the performance of the proposed approach with the existing approaches, discussed in this paper for different types and sizes of workflows. The results demonstrate that the heuristic-based scheduling techniques can adapt to the dynamic nature of resource and avoid performance degradation in dynamically changing grid environments. Finally, we outline a hybrid heuristic combining the features of the proposed adaptive scheduling technique with metaheuristics for optimizing execution cost and time as well as meeting the users requirements to efficiently manage the dynamism and heterogeneity of the hybrid cloud environment.

When a task arrives at a node, the local scheduler at that node attempts to guarantee that the task will complete execution on that node before its deadline. If the attempt fails, the scheduling components on individual nodes cooperate to determine which other node in the system has sufficient resource surplus to guarantee the task. Simulation studies are performed to compare the performance of these algorithms with respect to each other as well to two baselines. The first baseline is the noncooperative algorithm where a task that cannot be guaranteed locally is not sent to any other node. The second is an (ideal) algorithm that behaves exactly like the bidding algorithm but incurs no communication overheads. The simulation studies examine how communication delay, task laxity, load differences on the nodes, and task computation times affect the performance of the algorithms. The results show that distributed scheduling is effective even in a hard real-time environment and that the relative performance of these algorithms is a function of the system state.{$<$}{$>$}},

VCONF employs model-based RL algorithms to address the scalability and adaptability issues in applying RL in systems management. Experimental results on both controlled environments and a testbed of clouds with Xen VMs and representative server workloads demonstrate the effectiveness of VCONF. The approach is able to find optimal (near optimal) configurations in small scale systems and shows good adaptability and scalability.},

However, when targeting heterogeneous architectures, it is still an open problem how to distribute the work among the CPU cores and the accelerators. In this paper, we assess several approaches to perform BFS on different heterogeneous chips (a multicore CPU and an integrated GPU). In particular, we propose three heterogeneous approaches that exploit the collaboration between both devices: Selective, Concurrent and Asynchronous. We identify how to take advantage of the features of social network graphs, that are a particular example of highly connected graphs-with fewer iterations and more unbalanced-, as well as the drawbacks of each algorithmic implementation. One key feature of our approaches is that they switch between different versions of the algorithm, depending on the device that collaborates in the computation. Through exhaustive evaluation we find that our heterogeneous implementations can be up to 1.56\texttimes ~faster and 1.32\texttimes ~more energy efficient with respect to the best baseline where only one device is used, being the overhead w.r.t. an oracle scheduler below 10\%. We also compare with other related heterogeneous approach finding that ours can be up to 3.6\texttimes ~faster.},

  abstract = {In the last years, temporal differences methods have been put forward as convenient tools for reinforcement learning. Techniques based on temporal differences, however, suffer from a serious drawback: as stochastic adaptive algorithms, they may need extensive exploration of the state-action space before convergence is achieved. Although the basic methods are now reasonably well understood, it is precisely the structural simplicity of the reinforcement learning principle \textendash learning through experimentation \textendash{} that causes these excessive demands on the learning agent. Additionally, one must consider that the agent is very rarely a tabula rasa: some rough knowledge about characteristics of the surrounding environment is often available. In this paper, I present methods for embedding a priori knowledge in a reinforcement learning technique in such a way that both the mathematical structure of the basic learning algorithm and the capacity to generalise experience across the state-action space are kept. Extensive experimental results show that the resulting variants may lead to good performance, provided a sensible balance between risky use of prior imprecise knowledge and cautious use of learning experience is adopted.},

However, it presents various challenges that need to be addressed in order to be efficiently utilized for workflow applications. Although the workflow scheduling problem has been widely studied, there are very few initiatives tailored for cloud environments. Furthermore, the existing works fail to either meet the user's quality of service (QoS) requirements or to incorporate some basic principles of cloud computing such as the elasticity and heterogeneity of the computing resources. This paper proposes a resource provisioning and scheduling strategy for scientific workflows on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds. We present an algorithm based on the meta-heuristic optimization technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO), which aims to minimize the overall workflow execution cost while meeting deadline constraints. Our heuristic is evaluated using CloudSim and various well-known scientific workflows of different sizes. The results show that our approach performs better than the current state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The ever-growing data and compute requirements of these applications has led to extensive research on how to efficiently schedule and deploy them in distributed environments. The emergence of the latest distributed systems paradigm, cloud computing, brings with it tremendous opportunities to run scientific workflows at low costs without the need of owning any infrastructure. It provides a virtually infinite pool of resources that can be acquired, configured, and used as needed and are charged on a pay-per-use basis. However, along with these benefits come numerous challenges that need to be addressed to generate efficient schedules. This work identifies these challenges and studies existing algorithms from the perspective of the scheduling models they adopt as well as the resource and application model they consider. A detailed taxonomy that focuses on features particular to clouds is presented, and the surveyed algorithms are classified according to it.

Emerging Workflow as a Service (WaaS) platforms offer scientists a simple, easily accessible, and cost-effective way of deploying their applications in the cloud at anytime and from anywhere. They are multi-tenant frameworks and are designed to manage the execution of a continuous workload of heterogeneous workflows. To achieve this, they leverage the compute, storage, and network resources offered by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers. Hence, at any given point in time, a WaaS platform should be capable of efficiently scheduling an arbitrarily large number of workflows with different characteristics and quality of service requirements. As a result, we propose a resource provisioning and scheduling strategy designed specifically for WaaS environments. The algorithm is scalable and dynamic to adapt to changes in the environment and workload. It leverages containers to address resource utilization inefficiencies and aims to minimize the overall cost of leasing the infrastructure resources while meeting the deadline constraint of each individual workflow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that explicitly addresses VM sharing in the context of WaaS by modeling the use of containers in the resource provisioning and scheduling heuristics. Our simulation results demonstrate its responsiveness to environmental uncertainties, its ability to meet deadlines, and its cost-efficiency when compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm.},

To take full advantage of multi-core processing, computation-intensive real-time systems must exploit intra-task parallelism. In this paper, we address the problem of realtime scheduling for a general model of deterministic parallel tasks, where each task is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with nodes having arbitrary execution requirements. We prove processor-speed augmentation bounds for both preemptive and nonpreemptive real-time scheduling for general DAG tasks on multi-core processors. We first decompose each DAG into sequential tasks with their own release times and deadlines. Then we prove that these decomposed tasks can be scheduled using preemptive global EDF with a resource augmentation bound of 4. This bound is as good as the best known bound for more restrictive models, and is the first for a general DAG model. We also prove that the decomposition has a resource augmentation bound of 4 plus a constant non-preemption overhead for non-preemptive global EDF scheduling. To our knowledge, this is the first resource augmentation bound for non-preemptive scheduling of parallel tasks. Finally, we evaluate our analytical results through simulations that demonstrate that the derived resource augmentation bounds are safe in practice.},

This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

In this work, a number of algorithmic improvements are implemented in the AGLIBRARY optimization solver, that manages trains at the microscopic level of block sections and block signals and at a precision of seconds. The solver outcome is a detailed conflict-free train schedule, being able to avoid deadlocks and to minimize train delays. The proposed algorithmic framework starts from a good initial solution for the train scheduling problem with fixed routes, obtained via a truncated branch-and-bound algorithm. Variable neighbourhood search and tabu search metaheuristics are then applied to improve the solution by re-routing some trains. Computational experiments are performed on a UK railway network with dense traffic in order to compare the two types of studied metaheuristics.},

Scheduling of workflows is a problem of finding a correct execution sequence for the workflow tasks, i.e., execution that obeys the constraints that embody the business logic of the workflow. Research on workflow scheduling has largely concentrated on temporal constraints, which specify correct ordering of tasks. Another important class of constraints \textemdash{} those that arise from resource allocation \textemdash{} has received relatively little attention in workflow modeling. Since typically resources are not limitless and cannot be shared, scheduling of a workflow execution involves decisions as to which resources to use and when. In this work, we present a framework for workflows whose correctness is given by a set of resource allocation constraints and develop techniques for scheduling such systems. Our framework integrates Concurrent Transaction Logic (CTR) with constraint logic programming (CLP), yielding a new logical formalism, which we call Concurrent Constraint Transaction Logic, or CCTR.},

Execution of a task has a cost and this may vary depending on the resources allocated in order to execute that task. Resource allocation constraints define restrictions on how to allocate resources, and scheduling under resource allocation constraints provide proper resource allocation to tasks. In this work, we provide an architecture to specify and to schedule workflows under resource allocation constraints as well as under the temporal and causality constraints.

In fact, parameters of an optimization process at any rescheduling point are selected by continually improving policy which comes from RL. The scheduling method is based on variable neighborhood search (VNS) which is introduced to address the DJSS problem. A new approach is also introduced to calculate reward values in learning processes based on quality of selected parameters. The proposed method is compared with general variable neighborhood search and some common dispatching rules that have been widely used in the literature for the DJSS problem. Results illustrate the high performance of the proposed method in a simulated environment.},

  abstract = {To provide robust infrastructure as a service, clouds currently perform load balancing by migrating virtual machines (VMs) from heavily loaded physical machines (PMs) to lightly loaded PMs. Previous reactive load balancing algorithms migrate VMs upon the occurrence of load imbalance, while previous proactive load balancing algorithms predict PM overload to conduct VM migration. However, both methods cannot maintain long-term load balance and produce high overhead and delay due to migration VM selection and destination PM selection. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we propose a proactive Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based load balancing algorithm. We handle the challenges of allying MDP in virtual resource management in cloud datacenters, which allows a PM to proactively find an optimal action to transit to a lightly loaded state that will maintain for a longer period of time. We also apply the MDP to determine destination PMs to achieve long-term PM load balance state. Our algorithm reduces the numbers of service level agreement (SLA) violations by long-term load balance maintenance, and also reduces the load balancing overhead (e.g., CPU time and energy) and delay by quickly identifying VMs and destination PMs to migrate. We further propose enhancement methods for higher performance. First, we propose a cloud profit oriented reward system in the MDP model so that when the MDP tries to maximize the rewards for load balance, it concurrently improves the actual profit of the datacenter. Second, we propose a new MDP model, which considers the actions for both migrating a VM out of a PM and migrating a VM into a PM, in order to reduce the overhead and improve the effectiveness of load balancing. Our trace-driven experiments show that our algorithm outperforms both previous reactive and proactive load balancing algorithms in terms of SLA violation, load balancing efficiency, and long-term load balance maintenance. Our experimental results also show the effectiveness of our proposed enhancement methods.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as prominent paradigm in distributed computing which provides on-demand services to users. It involves challenging areas like workflow scheduling to decide the sequence in which the applications are to be scheduled on several computing resources. Due to NP-complete nature of workflow scheduling, finding an optimal solution is very challenging task. Thus, a meta-heuristic approach such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) can be a promising technique to obtain a near-optimal solution of this problem. Several workflow scheduling algorithms have been developed in recent years but quite a few of them focuses on two or more parameters of scheduling at a time like usage cost, makespan, utilization of resource, load balancing etc. In this paper, we present a PSO based workflow scheduling which consider two such conflicting parameters i.e., makespan and resource utilization. With meticulous experiments on standard workflows we find that our proposed approach outperforms genetic algorithm based workflow scheduling in all cases achieving 100\% results.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations may be composed of scientific programs chained in a coherent flow and executed in High Performance Computing environments. These executions may present anomalies associated to the data that flows in parallel among programs. Several parallel code-profiling tools already support performance analysis, such as Tuning and Analysis Utilities (TAU) or provide fine-grained performance statistics such as the System Activity Report (SAR). However, these tools do not associate their results to their corresponding dataflows. Such analysis is fundamental to trace back the data origins of an error. In this paper, we propose to couple a workflow monitoring data approach to parallel code-profiling tools for workflow executions. The goal is to profile and debug parallel workflow executions by querying a database that is able to integrate performance, resource consumption, provenance, and domain data from simulation programs at runtime. We have implemented our data monitoring approach as a software component that was coupled to TAU and SAR code profiling tools. We show how querying the resulting integrated database enables domain-aware runtime steering of performance anomalies by using the astronomy Montage workflow, as a motivating example. We observe that the overhead introduced by our approach is negligible.},

The problem of scheduling the workflows on HCS is proven to be NP-Complete. In the present work, Branch and Bound (B\&B) strategy for scheduling the workflows on HCS is proposed to attain globally optimal solutions. The primary merit of the proposed strategy is due to the estimation of the rank functions which are sharper and not complex. The proposed B\&B strategy expands the most promising states first. The sharper ranks aid in converging to the solution quickly by pruning the unpromising states which do not lead to an optimal solution. Therefore, the search space is drastically reduced hence higher performance can be expected. The experimental results reveal that the proposed B\&B scheme is efficient in exploring high potentials of B\&B strategy in finding exact solutions. The performance analysis on a set of benchmark workflows shows that the proposed B\&B strategy has generated optimal schedules for 94.37\% of the cases.},

Two paradigms, CLP (constraint logic programming) and MP (mathematical programming), are integrated in the framework. The integration is supplemented with the original method of problem transformation, used in the framework as a presolving method. The transformation substantially reduces the feasible solution space. The framework automatically generates CSP and COP models based on current values of data instances, questions asked by a user, and set of predicates and facts of the problem being modeled, which altogether constitute a knowledge database for the given problem. This dynamic generation of dedicated models, based on the knowledge base, together with the parameters changing externally, for example, the user's questions, is the implementation of the autonomous search concept. The models are solved using the internal or external solvers integrated with the framework. The architecture of the framework as well as its implementation outline is also included in the paper. The effectiveness of the framework regarding the modeling and solution search is assessed through the illustrative examples relating to scheduling problems with additional constrained resources.},

  abstract = {Workflow technology has been adopted in scientific domains to orchestrate and automate scientific processes in order to facilitate experimentation. Such scientific workflows often involve large data sets and intensive computation that necessitate the use of the Grid. To execute a scientific workflow in the Grid, tasks within the workflow are assigned to Grid resources. Thus, to ensure efficient execution of the workflow, Grid workflow scheduling is required to manage the allocation of Grid resources. Although many Grid workflow scheduling techniques exist, they are mainly designed for the execution of a single workflow. This is not the case with parameter sweep workflows, which are used for parametric study and optimisation. A parameter sweep workflow is executed numerous times with different input parameters in order to determine the effect of each parameter combination on the experiment. While executing multiple instances of a parameter sweep workflow in parallel can reduce the time required for the overall execution, this parallel execution introduces new challenges to Grid workflow scheduling. Not only is a scheduling algorithm that is able to manage multiple workflow instances required, but this algorithm also needs the ability to schedule tasks across multiple workflow instances judiciously, as tasks may require the same set of Grid resources. Without appropriate resource allocation, resource competition problem could arise. We propose a new Grid workflow scheduling technique for parameter sweep workflow called the Besom scheduling algorithm. The scheduling decision of our algorithm is based on the resource dependencies of tasks in the workflow, as well as conventional Grid resource-performance metrics. In addition, the proposed technique is extended to handle loop structures in scientific workflows without using existing loop-unrolling techniques. The Besom algorithm is evaluated using simulations with a variety of scenarios. A comparison between the simulation results of the Besom algorithm and of the three existing Grid workflow scheduling algorithms shows that the Besom algorithm is able to perform better than the existing algorithms for workflows that have complex structures and that involve overlapping resource dependencies of tasks.},

We identify and explain the aspects and classifications unique to workflow scheduling in the cloud environment in three categories, namely, scheduling process, task and resource. Lastly, review of several scheduling techniques are included and classified onto the proposed taxonomies.

However, the inherently dynamic nature of grid workflow scheduling, stemming from the unavailability of scheduling information and from resource contention among the (multiple) workflows and the non-workflow system load, may lead to poor or unpredictable performance. In this paper we present a comprehensive and realistic investigation of the performance of a wide range of dynamic workflow scheduling policies in multicluster grids. We first introduce a taxonomy of grid workflow scheduling policies that is based on the amount of dynamic information used in the scheduling process, and map to this taxonomy seven such policies across the full spectrum of information use. Then, we analyze the performance of these scheduling policies through simulations and experiments in a real multicluster grid. We find that there is no single grid workflow scheduling policy with good performance across all the investigated scenarios. We also find from our real system experiments that with demanding workloads, the limitations of the head-nodes of the grid clusters may lead to performance loss not expected from the simulation results. We show that task throttling, that is, limiting the per-workflow number of tasks dispatched to the system, prevents the head-nodes from becoming overloaded while largely preserving performance, at least for communication-intensive workflows.},

  abstract = {In trying to solve multiobjective optimization problems, many traditional methods scalarize the objective vector into a single objective. In those cases, the obtained solution is highly sensitive to the weight vector used in the scalarization process and demands that the user have knowledge about the underlying problem. Moreover, in solving multiobjective problems, designers may be interested in a set of Pareto-optimal points, instead of a single point. Since genetic algorithms (GAs) work with a population of points, it seems natural to use GAs in multiobjective optimization problems to capture a number of solutions simultaneously. Although a vector evaluated GA (VEGA) has been implemented by Schaffer and has been tried to solve a number of multiobjective problems, the algorithm seems to have bias toward some regions. In this paper, we investigate Goldberg's notion of nondominated sorting in GAs along with a niche and speciation method to find multiple Pareto-optimal points simultaneously. The proof-of-principle results obtained on three problems used by Schaffer and others suggest that the proposed method can be extended to higher dimensional and more difficult multiobjective problems. A number of suggestions for extension and application of the algorithm are also discussed.},

Specifically, we investigate via simulation the performance of a heterogeneous distributed system, where multiple soft real-time workflow applications arrive dynamically. The applications are scheduled under various tardiness bounds, taking into account the communication cost in the first case study and the I/O cost and data locality in the second. The simulation results provide useful insights into the impact of tardiness bound and data locality on the system performance.},

This work reviews the current Apache OpenWhisk serverless event load balancing and a noncooperative game-theoretic load balancing approach for response time minimization in distributed systems. It is shown by simulation that neither performs well under high system utilization which inspired a noncooperative online allocation heuristic that allows tuning the trade-off between for response time and resource cost of each serverless function.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing is the latest utility computing that enables the dynamic provisioning for applications over the Internet. Cloud computing provide large number of opportunities to solve large scale scientific problems. Scheduling the tasks in the workflows is an NP-hard problem and in this work we focus on optimizing the scheduling process of the workflow. Scheduling of the workflow applications that satisfy the given constraints for the scientific tasks is an essential requirement for the workflow scheduling. Mapping of each task to suitable resource and allowing the task to satisfy performance constraints is the main aim of this paper. In the present work we propose game theoretic algorithm for multi-objective scheduling of scientific workflows in cloud computing environment. The scheduling problem is formulated as a new sequential cooperative game based on two user objectives that are execution time and economic cost while fulfilling two constraints network bandwidth and storage requirements. We call it as Game Multi Objective (GMO) algorithm. In this paper we apply Game Multi Objective algorithm for minimizing the execution time and cost of an workflow application.},

The purpose of this Paper is to optimize a class of Integrated Reliability Model for Redundant Systems with weight as additional constraint apart from basic cost constraint. By taking the mathematical function the optimum component reliability, stage reliability, the number of components in each stage and the system reliability are determined after taking the pre-determined values of Cost and Weight. In this work, an attempt is made to develop an integrated reliability redundant model for a Series \textendash{} Parallel configuration subject to the multiple constraints. Generally reliability is treated as the function of Cost but in any given practical situation apart from Cost other constraint like Weight will have hidden impact on the reliability of the system. In this model the Lagrangean technique is implemented to determine the Cost and Weight as constraints. The model has yielded very encouraging results and it can be applied to any type of system, simple or complex. The advantage of this model is very flexible and requires little processing time.},

However, hand-writing these code is a troublesome and error-prone work. We propose a multi-view data model where users can specify rules of data decomposition for multi-dimensional data to change data layout on top of processes and define unit of parallel processing by simple directives. Our framework conducts data arrangement and affinity-aware task scheduling transparently from users by following the specified rules. Through a case study of a lattice QCD simulation program, we confirmed that our proposal reduced programming efforts against hand-written MPI code with performance penalties up to 17\%.},

  abstract = {ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCSP) involves the scheduling of a number of activities over time, where each activity consumes a unit of some resource per time period. 
For a feasible solution to exist, the total resource consumption per time period must be less than 
or equal to the available resources. In addition, the order in which activities may be scheduled is determined by a precedence graph. The nodes of this directed graph represent the various activities and each directed edge a precedence relationship. A multitude of model formulations for the RCSP exist in the literature as do various solution approaches. Some of the frequently 
applied objective functions include the minimisation of the makespan, the minimisation of a tardiness penalty cost, and the maximisation of net present value. 
The advent of practical computer technology during the late 1950s has meant that various industrial problems can now be solved by computer algorithms. It soon became clear, however, that certain types of problems are inherently difficult and in some cases even impossible to solve. 
Even today scheduling problems exist which have no more than 60 tasks to be scheduled, but 
which cannot be solved to optimality within reasonable time using the latest algorithmic and computer technology. In this dissertation, the challenges of underground mine planning are addressed by employing 
RCSP models and algorithms. Underground mine planning entails the scheduling of mining activities in a manner that the most economical value is derived, while satisfying constraints related to resource requirements and physical limitations due to the properties of the mine infrastructure. 
Modelling extensions that address mining-specific requirements are of specific interest. For instance, the modelling of transfer delay constraints are especially useful in a mechanised mining environment where the movement of large machinery from one point to another may cause significant delays in a mine production schedule. Other mining-specific requirements include 
the modelling of uncertainty in resource requirements as well as the formulation of scheduling 
models that facilitate selective scheduling. 
Details of existing RCSP formulations in the literature are provided and results from empirical tests are presented to evaluate the suitability of adopting a resource  
flow-based RCSP formulation to solve the underground mine scheduling optimisation problem. Modifications to the resource flow formulation are proposed for the purpose of accommodating the maximisation of 
net present value. Due to the computational complexity of the underground mine scheduling problem, variable and constraint reduction approaches are suggested. In addition, a Benders decomposition approach is described which is capable of improving the computation of feasible 
solutions for large problem instances. 
Computational results presented in this dissertation are based on both randomly generated data and data from a real South African underground mine. Based on these results it is found that the best performing model reformulation involves the use of a resource  
ow-based model in conjunction with a constraint aggregation and graph reduction approach. The Benders decomposition approach, implemented within a branch-and-cut framework, scales well for problem instances with a large number of activities and resources. This is a significant contribution within the context of mining, especially considering the large number of resources that have to be accommodated when solving underground mine scheduling optimisation problems.},

  abstract = {Dynamic scheduling problems consist of both challenging combinatorics, as found in classical scheduling problems, and stochastics due to uncertainty about the arrival times, resource requirements, and processing times of jobs. To address these two challenges, we investigate the integration of queueing theory and scheduling. The former reasons about long-run stochastic system characteristics, whereas the latter typically deals with shortterm combinatorics. We investigate two simple problems to isolate the core differences and potential synergies between the two approaches: a two-machine dynamic flowshop and a flexible queueing network. We show for the first time that stability, a fundamental characteristic in queueing theory, can be applied to approaches that periodically solve combinatorial scheduling problems. We empirically demonstrate that for a dynamic flowshop, the use of combinatorial reasoning has little impact on schedule quality beyond queueing approaches. In contrast, for the more complicated flexible queueing network, a novel algorithm that combines long-term guidance from queueing theory with short-term combinatorial decision making outperforms all other tested approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a hybrid of queueing theory and scheduling techniques has been proposed and evaluated.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines scenarios where multiple autonomous agents collaborate in order to accomplish a global objective. In the environment that we consider, there is a network of agents, each of which offers different sets of capabilities or services that can be used to perform various tasks. In this environment, an agent formulates a problem, divides it into a precedence-constrained set of sub-problems, and determines the optimal allocation of these sub-problems/tasks to other agents so that they are completed in the shortest amount of time. The resulting schedule is constrained by the execution delay of each service, job release times and precedence relations, as well as communication delays between agents. A Mixed Integer-Linear Programming (MILP) approach is presented in the context of a multi-agent problem-solving framework that enables optimal makespans to be computed for complex classifications of scheduling problems that take many different parameters into account. While the algorithm presented takes exponential time to solve and thus is only feasible to use for limited numbers of agents and jobs, it provides a flexible alternative to existing heuristics that model only limited sets of parameters, or settle for approximations of the optimal solution.

The algorithm aims to allocate job classes to machine configurations to attain an efficient mapping between job resource request profiles and machine resource capacity profiles. The first stage uses a queueing model that treats the system in an aggregated manner with pooled machines and jobs represented as a fluid flow. The latter two stages use combinatorial optimization techniques to solve a shorter-term, more accurate representation of the problem using the first-stage, long-term solution for heuristic guidance. In the second stage, jobs and machines are discretized. A linear programming model is used to obtain a solution to the discrete problem that maximizes the system capacity given a restriction on the job class and machine configuration pairings based on the solution of the first stage. The final stage is a scheduling policy that uses the solution from the second stage to guide the dispatching of arriving jobs to machines. We present experimental results of our algorithm on both Google workload trace data and generated data and show that it outperforms existing schedulers. These results illustrate the importance of considering heterogeneity of both job and machine configuration profiles in making effective scheduling decisions.},

We explore the importance of these parameters, showing that it is possible to produce a network with compelling performance using only non-artisticallygenerated synthetic data. With additional fine-tuning on real data, the network yields better performance than using real data alone. This result opens up the possibility of using inexpensive synthetic data for training neural networks while avoiding the need to collect large amounts of handannotated real-world data or to generate high-fidelity synthetic worlds\textemdash both of which remain bottlenecks for many applications.

This work focuses on developing a model and a decision support framework for industrial application of the cumulative global constraint. For a given project scheduling, the proposed approach allows the generation of different optimal solutions relative to the alternate availability of outsourcing and resources. The objective is to provide a decision-maker an assistance to construct, choose, and define the appropriate scheduling program taking into account the possible capacity resources. The industrial problem under consideration is modeled as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). It is implemented under the constraint programming language CHIP V5. The provided solutions determine values for the various variables associated to the tasks realized on each resource, as well as the curves with the profile of the total consumption of resources on time.},

To provide performance information for building such knowledge, Grid workflow performance tools have to select, measure, and analyze various performance metrics of workflows. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive study of performance metrics which can be used to evaluate the performance of a workflow executed in the Grid. Moreover, given the complexity of both Grid systems and workflows, semantics of essential performance-related concepts and relationships, and associated performance data in Grid workflows should be well described. In this paper, we analyze performance metrics that performance monitoring and analysis tools should provide during the evaluation of the performance of Grid workflows. Performance metrics are associated with multiple levels of abstraction. We introduce an ontology for describing performance data of Grid workflows and illustrate how the ontology can be utilized for monitoring and analyzing the performance of Grid workflows.},

  abstract = {Workflow scheduling has long been an important research topic in the field of parallel computing. Clustering-based methods are one of the major types of workflow scheduling approaches which have been shown superior to other kinds of methods in many cases due to their advantage of minimizing inter-task communication costs. Most previous research dealt with single workflow scheduling and focused on how to cluster the tasks within a workflow into a set of task groups. Recent research showed that utilizing idle time gaps between scheduled tasks is a promising direction for efficient multiple workflow scheduling. Since executing multiple workflows simultaneously is an inevitable need in modern shared parallel computing platforms, efficient task group allocation becomes a critical issue. In this paper, we studied such issue and proposed an innovative dual-criteria task group allocation method which considers both task group's finish time and potential resource utilization to effectively improve overall multi-workflow execution performance. In addition, an adaptive task group rearrangement mechanism was adopted to further improve performance. The proposed method has been evaluated with a series of simulation experiments and compared to previous approaches. The experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches across different workload conditions and workflow properties in terms of average makespan. The performance improvement ranges from 5 to 29 \% for different conditions, achieving the largest performance improvement for workflows of smaller CCR.},

More than just being a bottleneck, parallel I/O performance at scale is notoriously variable, being influenced by numerous factors inside and outside the application, thus making it extremely difficult to isolate cause and effect for performance events. In this paper, we propose a statistical approach to understanding I/O performance that moves from the analysis of performance events to the exploration of performance ensembles. Using this methodology, we examine two I/O-intensive scientific computations from cosmology and climate science, and demonstrate that our approach can identify application and middleware performance deficiencies - resulting in more than 4\texttimes{} run time improvement for both examined applications.},

The target is to minimize the overall execution time of the DAG known as schedule length or makespan. An approach called MATH using the full model is applied to small sized problems and then a more elaborate approach called MATHL is presented where the DAG is partitioned to levels. Levels are formed according to the hops needed for each node to be reached starting from the source node. Hence sub-problems have manageable size and can be solved in a timely manner. Consecutive optimal solutions for each level result in a high quality schedule for the overall problem even for cases consisting of several hundreds of nodes. Results show that this method constantly gives very good results and it is compared favorably with other approaches to the problem that can be found in the bibliography.},

  abstract = {Load balancing is one of the key components in many distributed systems as it heavily impacts performance and resource utilization. We consider a heterogeneous system where each server belongs to one of K classes and the speed of the server depends on its class. Arriving jobs are immediately dispatched to a server class in a randomized manner, i.e., with probability \textbackslash (p\_k\textbackslash ) a job is assigned to class k. Within each class a power of d choices rule is used to select the server that executes the job.For large systems and exponential job size durations the optimal probabilities \textbackslash (p\_k\textbackslash ) to minimize the mean response time can be determined easily via convex optimization. In this paper we develop a mean field model (validated by simulation) to investigate how these optimal probabilities \textbackslash (p\_k\textbackslash ) are affected by the higher moments and in particular by the variability of the job size distribution when the service discipline at each server is first-come-first-served. The main insight provided is that optimizing the probabilities \textbackslash (p\_k\textbackslash ) based on the higher moments is much more involved and provides only a non negligible gain for very specific system load regions.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing has become a new age technology that has got huge potentials in enterprises and markets. Clouds can make it possible to access applications and associated data from anywhere. Companies are able to rent resources from cloud for storage and other computational purposes so that their infrastructure cost can be reduced significantly. Further they can make use of company-wide access to applications, based on payas-you-go model. Hence there is no need for getting licenses for individual products. However one of the major pitfalls in cloud computing is related to optimizing the resources being allocated. Because of the uniqueness of the model, resource allocation is performed with the objective of minimizing the costs associated with it. The other challenges of resource allocation are meeting customer demands and application requirements. In this paper, various resource allocation strategies and their challenges are discussed in detail. It is believed that this paper would benefit both cloud users and researchers in overcoming the challenges faced.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment), a reinforcement learning environment based on the StarCraft II game. This domain poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more difficult class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of StarCraft II gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are unable to make significant progress. Thus, SC2LE offers a new and challenging environment for exploring deep reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures.},

As Cloud resource providers, they should guarantee as many as possible DAGs be accomplished within their deadline when they face the overstep request of computer resource. In this paper, we define the urgency of DAG and introduce the MTMD (Maximize Throughput of Multi-DAG with Deadline) algorithm to improve the ratio of DAGs which can be accomplished within deadline. The urgency of DAG is changing among execution and determine the execution order of tasks. We can detect DAGs which will exceed the deadline by this algorithm and abandon these DAGs timely. Based on the MTMD algorithm, we put forward the CFS (Cost Fairness Scheduling) algorithm to reduce the unfairness of cost between different DAGs. The simulation results show that the MTMD algorithm outperforms three other algorithms and the CFS algorithm reduces the cost of all DAGs by 12.1 \% on average and reduces the unfairness among DAGs by 54.5 \% on average.},

Unfortunately, most dynamic workflow scheduling algorithms fail to take fairness into account or adapt unreasonable fairness policy, which will probably result in some DAGs' scheduling failure in certain scenarios when they can't complete all the tasks before deadline. Aiming at the need to solve the flaws mentioned above, we propose a novel dynamic workflow scheduling algorithm named FSDP (Fairness Scheduling with Dynamic Priority for Multi Workflow). The algorithm focuses on the deadline of each workflow to achieve a more reasonable fairness when allocating the processors so that those urgent workflows can acquire a higher priority. Also, a new metric, urgency, is proposed to update priority. Experimental results show that it is possible to meet different requirements of dynamic workflows.},

One of the main challenges is that such workflow scheduling problems involve many constraints, requirements and varied objectives and it is extremely difficult to find high-quality solutions. To meet the challenge, we explore using mixed integer programming (MIP) to formulate and solve complex workflow scheduling problems. To illustrate the MIPbased method, we formulate three related workflow scheduling problems in MIP. They are fairly generic, comprehensive and are expected to be useful for a wide range of workflow scheduling scenarios. Using results from numerical experiments, we demonstrate that, for problems up to certain size, the MIP approach is entirely applicable and more advantageous over heuristic algorithms.},

Scheduling multiple workflows on distributed computing systems like Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds is well recognized as a fundamental NP-complete problem that is critical to meeting various types of Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization workflow scheduling approach based on dynamic game-theoretic model aiming at reducing workflow make-spans, reducing total cost, and maximizing system fairness in terms of workload distribution among heterogeneous cloud virtual machines (VMs). We conduct extensive case studies as well based on various well-known scientific workflow templates and real-world third-party commercial IaaS clouds.

Nevertheless, various challenges, especially its optimal scheduling for multiple conflicting objectives, are yet to be addressed properly. The existing multi-objective workflow scheduling approaches are still limited in many ways, e.g., encoding is restricted by prior experts' knowledge when handling a dynamic real-time problem, which strongly influences the performance of scheduling. In this paper, we apply a deep-Q-network model in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting to guide the scheduling of multi-workflows over infrastructure-as-a-service clouds. To optimize multi-workflow completion time and user's cost, we consider a Markov game model, which takes the number of workflow applications and heterogeneous virtual machines as state input and the maximum completion time and cost as rewards. The game model is capable of seeking for correlated equilibrium between make-span and cost criteria without prior experts' knowledge and converges to the correlated equilibrium policy in a dynamic real-time environment. To validate our proposed approach, we conduct extensive case studies based on multiple well-known scientific workflow templates and Amazon EC2 cloud. The experimental results clearly suggest that our proposed approach outperforms traditional ones, e.g., non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, multi-objective particle swarm optimization, and game-theoretic-based greedy algorithms, in terms of optimality of scheduling plans generated.},

In particular, job scheduling is a non-trivial task, which is responsible for allocating massive job requests submitted by users to the most suitable resources and satisfying user QoS requirements as much as possible. Inspired by recent success of using deep reinforcement learning techniques to solve AI control problems, in this paper, we propose an intelligent QoS-aware job scheduling framework for application providers. A deep reinforcement learning-based job scheduler is the key component of the framework. It is able to learn to make appropriate online job-to-VM decisions for continuous job requests directly from its experiences without any prior knowledge. Experimental results using synthetic workloads and real-world NASA workload traces show that compared with other baseline solutions, our proposed job scheduling approach can efficiently reduce average job response time (e.g., reduced by 40.4\% compared with the best baseline for NASA traces), guarantee the QoS at a high level (e.g., job success rate is higher than 93\% for all simulated changing workload scenarios), and adapt to different workload conditions.},

Existing studies provide different approaches to the multi-criteria Grid workflow scheduling problem, and address different variants of the problem. A profound understanding of the problem's nature can be an important step towards more generic scheduling approaches. Based on the related work and on our own experience, we propose several novel taxonomies of the problem, considering five facets: workflow model, scheduling criteria, scheduling process, resource model, and task model. We make a survey of the existing related work, and classify it according to the proposed taxonomies, identifying the most common use cases and the areas that have not been sufficiently explored yet.},

The game program provides a simple graphic user interface similar with traditional board games played by manipulating blocks, and the players can conveniently search the good schedules in a trial-and-error manner. Moreover, the completed schedules are evaluated by taking the schedules generated by the genetic algorithm into account. For reasonable evaluation, the game program adopts two search strategies called forward and backward search to generate schedules with a wide range of makespans. The integrated job shop scheduling game introduced is well-organized to support overall procedures for job shop scheduling, and the genetic algorithm based evaluation can make the players to compete for better schedules.

Task-based programming paradigms have the capability to alleviate some of the programming challenges on distributed hybrid many-core architectures. In this paper we take this concept a step further by showing that the potential of task-based programming paradigms can be greatly increased with minimal modification of the underlying runtime combined with the right algorithmic changes. We propose two novel recursive algorithmic variants for one-sided factorizations and describe the changes to the PaRSEC task-scheduling runtime to build a framework where the task granularity is dynamically adjusted to adapt the degree of available parallelism and kernel efficiency according to runtime conditions. Based on an extensive set of results, we show that, with one-sided factorizations, i.e. Colicky, and QR, a carefully written algorithm, supported by an adaptive tasks-based runtime, is capable of reaching a degree of performance and scalability never achieved before in distributed hybrid environments.},

We first used a logistic regression model to predict the satisfiability of propositional boolean formulae after fixing the values of a certain fraction of the variables in each formula. We then applied the logistic model and added a preprocessing period to Minisat to determine the preferable initial value (either true or false) of each boolean variable using a Monte-Carlo approach. Concretely, for each MonteCarlo trial, we fixed the values of a certain ratio of randomly selected variables, and calculated the confidence that the resulting sub-formula is satisfiable with our logistic regression model. The initial value of each variable was set based on the mean confidence scores of the trials that started from the literals of that variable. We were particularly interested in setting the initial values of the backbone variables correctly, which are variables that have the same value in all solutions of a SAT formula. Our Monte-Carlo method was able to set 78\% of the backbones correctly. Excluding the preprocessing time, compared with the default setting of Minisat, the runtime of Minisat for satisfiable formulae decreased by 23\%. However, our method did not outperform vanilla Minisat in runtime, as the decrease in the conflicts was outweighed by the long runtime of the preprocessing period.},

It includes an interface for expressing complex data reduction pipelines consisting of both datasets and algorithmic components and an implementation run-time to execute such pipelines on distributed resources. By mapping the logical view of a pipeline to its physical realisation, DALiuGE separates the concerns of multiple stakeholders, allowing them to collectively optimise large-scale data processing solutions in a coherent manner. The execution in DALiuGE is data-activated, where each individual data item autonomously triggers the processing on itself. Such decentralisation also makes the execution framework very scalable and flexible, supporting pipeline sizes ranging from less than ten tasks running on a laptop to tens of millions of concurrent tasks on the second fastest supercomputer in the world. DALiuGE has been used in production for reducing interferometry datasets from the Karl E. Jansky Very Large Array and the Mingantu Ultrawide Spectral Radioheliograph; and is being developed as the execution framework prototype for the Science Data Processor (SDP) consortium of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope. This paper presents a technical overview of DALiuGE and discusses case studies from the CHILES and MUSER projects that use DALiuGE to execute production pipelines. In a companion paper, we provide in-depth analysis of DALiuGE's scalability to very large numbers of tasks on two supercomputing facilities.},

  abstract = {On parallel and distributed heterogeneous computing systems, a heuristic-based task scheduling algorithm typically consists of two phases: task prioritization and processor selection. In a heuristic based task scheduling algorithm, different prioritization will produce different makespan on a heterogeneous computing system. Therefore, a good scheduling algorithm should be able to efficiently assign a priority to each subtask depending on the resources needed to minimize makespan. In this paper, a task scheduling scheme on heterogeneous computing systems using a multiple priority queues genetic algorithm (MPQGA) is proposed. The basic idea of our approach is to exploit the advantages of both evolutionary-based and heuristic-based algorithms while avoiding their drawbacks. The proposedalgorithm incorporates a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to assign a priority to each subtask while using a heuristic-based earliest finish time (EFT) approach to search for a solution for the task-to-processor mapping. The MPQGA method also designs crossover, mutation, and fitness function suitable for the scenario of directed acyclic graph (DAG) scheduling. The experimental results for large-sized problems from a large set of randomly generated graphs as well as graphs of real-world problems with various characteristics show that the proposed MPQGA algorithm outperforms two non-evolutionary heuristics and a random search method in terms of schedule quality.},

With ATSDWA, tasktrackers can adapt to the change of load at runtime, obtain tasks in accordance with the computing ability of their own, and realize the self-regulation, while avoiding the complexity of algorithm, which is the prime reason to make jobtracker the system performance bottleneck.

This study considers a decision problem formulated from the use of computing services over the Internet. An agent receives orders of computing tasks from his/her clients and on the other hand he/she acquires computing resources from computing service providers to fulfill the requirements of the clients. The processors are bundled as packages according to their speeds and the business strategies of the providers. The packages are rated at a certain pricing scheme to provide flexible purchasing options to the agent. The decision of the agent is to select the packages which can be acquired from the service providers and then schedule the tasks of the clients onto the processors of the acquired packages such that the total cost, including acquisition cost and scheduling cost (total weighted tardiness), is minimized. In this study, we present an integer programming model to formulate the problem and propose several solution methods to produce acquisition and scheduling plans. Ten well-known heuristics of parallel-machine scheduling are adapted to fit into the studied problem so as to provide initial solutions. Tabu search and genetic algorithm are tailored to reflect the problem nature for improving upon the initial solutions.

The task scheduling problem of cloud computing system is more complex than the traditional distributed system. Based on the analysis of cloud computing in related literature, we established a simplified model for task scheduling system in cloud computing.Different from the previous research of cloud computing task scheduling algorithm, the simplified model in this paper is based on game theory as a mathematical tool. Based on game theory, the task scheduling algorithm considering the reliability of the balanced task is proposed.

This in turn is vital to achieve service-oriented Grid computing that harnesses resources distributed worldwide based on users' objectives. Recently, numerous market-based RMSs have been proposed to make use of real-world market concepts and behavior to assign resources to users for various computing platforms. The aim of this paper is to develop a taxonomy that characterizes and classifies how market-based RMSs can support utility-driven cluster computing in practice. The taxonomy is then mapped to existing market-based RMSs designed for both cluster and other computing platforms to survey current research developments and identify outstanding issues.

It is almost impossible to make an optimal scheduling for the end-to-end workflow without considering the intermediate data movement. In order to reduce the complexity of the workflow-scheduling problem, most of the existing work constrains the problem space by some unrealistic assumptions, which result in non-optimal scheduling in practice. In this study, we propose a genetic data-aware algorithm for the end-to-end workflow scheduling problem. Distinct from the past research, we develop a novel data-aware evaluation function for each chromosome, a common augmenting crossover operator and a simple but effective mutation operator. Our experiments on different workflow structures show that the proposed GA based approach gives a scheduling close to the optimal one.},

When optimizing workflow execution on utility Grids, we need to consider multiple Quality of Service (QoS) parameters including service prices and execution time. These optimization objectives may be in conflict. In this paper, we have proposed a workflow execution planning approach using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Our goal was to generate a set of trade-off scheduling solutions according to the users QoS requirements. The alternative trade-off solutions offer more flexibility to users when estimating their QoS requirements of workflow executions. Simulation results show that MOEAs are able to find a range of compromise solutions in a short computational time.},

Many algorithms have been developed since, however most static algorithms are designed in the problem domain of scheduling single workflow applications, thus not applicable to a common cluster environment where multiple workflow applications and other independent jobs compete for resources. Dynamic scheduling approaches can handle the mixed workload practically by nature but their performance has yet to optimize as they do not have a global view of workflow applications. Recent research efforts suggest merging multiple workflows into one workflow before execution, but fail to address an important issue that multiple workflow applications may be submitted at different times by different users. In this paper, we propose a planner-guided dynamic scheduling strategy for multiple workflow applications, leveraging job dependence information and execution time estimation.Our approach schedules individual jobs dynamically without requiring merging the workflow applications a priori. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms two other algorithms by 43.6\% and 36.7\% with respect to workflow makespan and turnaround time respectively, and it performs even better when the number of concurrent workflow applications increases and the resources are scarce.},

RDDs are motivated by two types of applications that current computing frameworks handle inefficiently: iterative algorithms and interactive data mining tools. In both cases, keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of magnitude. To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory, based on coarsegrained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs, such as Pregel, and new applications that these models do not capture. We have implemented RDDs in a system called Spark, which we evaluate through a variety of user applications and benchmarks.},

When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, batch MTL models are difficult to handle this situation and online, parallel and distributed MTL models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing are reviewed to reveal their computational and storage advantages.

In this paper, a novel DAG scheduling approach is proposed to solve this stochastic scheduling problem, based on a Monte Carlo method. The approach is built on the top of a classic static DAG scheduling heuristic and evaluated through extensive simulation.

  abstract = {The normal studies on air traffic departure scheduling problem (DSP) mainly deal with an independent airport in which the departure traffic is not affected by surrounded airports, which, however, is not a consistent case. In reality, there still exist cases where several commercial airports are closely located and one of them possesses a higher priority. During the peak hours, the departure activities of the lower-priority airports are usually required to give way to those of higher-priority airport. These giving-way requirements can inflict a set of changes on the modeling of departure scheduling problem with respect to the lower-priority airports. To the best of our knowledge, studies on DSP under this condition are scarce. Accordingly, this paper develops a bi-objective integer programming model to address the flight departure scheduling of the partly-restricted (e.g., lower-priority) one among several adjacent airports. An adapted tabu search algorithm is designed to solve the current problem. It is demonstrated from the case study of Tianjin Binhai International Airport in China that the proposed method can obviously improve the operation efficiency, while still realizing superior equity and regularity among restricted flows.},

Implemented in B-Prolog, the interface allows the programmer to use the features of the host language such as recursion, pattern matching, arrays, and loops to describe problems. The interface provides an easy and uniform platform for exploring different solvers and models. This paper compares the performance of the CLP(FD) of B-Prolog, the CPLEX IP solver, and the Lingeling SAT solver on several problems through the same interface and for each problem it compares a model that uses Boolean variables and another model that uses general integer variables.

In this paper, we highlight such difficulties, and model the workflow scheduling problem which optimizes both makespan and cost as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) for the Cloud environments. We propose an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO)-based algorithm to solve this workflow scheduling problem on an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform. Novel schemes for problem-specific encoding and population initialization, fitness evaluation and genetic operators are proposed in this algorithm. Extensive experiments on real world workflows and randomly generated workflows show that the schedules produced by our evolutionary algorithm present more stability on most of the workflows with the instance-based IaaS computing and pricing models. The results also show that our algorithm can achieve significantly better solutions than existing state-of-the-art QoS optimization scheduling algorithms in most cases. The conducted experiments are based on the on-demand instance types of Amazon EC2; however, the proposed algorithm are easy to be extended to the resources and pricing models of other IaaS services.},
