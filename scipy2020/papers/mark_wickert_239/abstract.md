abstract: The focus of this paper is the bit error probability (BEP) performance
  degradation when the transmit and receive pulse shaping filters are
  mismatched. The modulation schemes considered are MPSK and MQAM. In the
  additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel both spectral efficiency and
  noise mitigation is commonly achieved by using square-root raised cosine (SRC)
  pulse shaping at both the transmitter and receiver. The novelty of this paper
  primarily lies in the use semi-analytic BEP simulation for conditional error
  probability calculations, with transmit and receive filter mismatch, the
  optional inclusion of a small FIR equalizer. For lower order MPSK and MQAM,
  i.e., 8PSK and 16QAM power degradation at is 0.1 dB when the excess bandwidth
  mismatch tx/rx = 0.25/0.35 or 0.35/0.25, but quickly grows as the modulation
  order increases and/or the mismatch increases.
