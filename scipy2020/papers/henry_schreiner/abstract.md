title: "Boost-histogram: High-Performance Histograms as Objects"
description: Unlike arrays and tables, histograms in Python have usually been
  denied their own object, and have been represented as a single operation
  producing several arrays. Boost-histogram is a new Python library that
  provides histograms that can be filled, manipulated, sliced, and projected as
  objects.
abstract: Unlike arrays and tables, histograms in Python have usually been
  denied their own object, and have been represented as a single operation
  producing several arrays. Boost-histogram is a new Python library that
  provides histograms that can be filled, manipulated, sliced, and projected as
  objects. Building on top of the Boost libraries' Histogram in C++14 provided
  interesting distribution and design challenges with useful solutions. This is
  meant to be a foundation that others can build on; in the Scikit-HEP project1,
  a physicist friendly front-end \textquotedbl{}Hist\textquotedbl{} and a
  conversion package \textquotedbl{}Aghast\textquotedbl{} are already being
  designed around boost-histogram.
