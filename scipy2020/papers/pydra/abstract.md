  neuroimaging community, but it is designed as a general-purpose dataflow
  engine to support any scientific domain. The paper describes the architecture
  of the software, as well as several useful features, that make Pydra a
  customizable and powerful dataflow engine. Two examples are presented to
  demonstrate the syntax and properties of the package."
