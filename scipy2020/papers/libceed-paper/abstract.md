  interface"
description: libCEED is a new lightweight, open-source library for
  high-performance matrix-free Finite Element computations. libCEED offers a
  portable interface to high-performance implementations, selectable at runtime,
  tuned for a variety of current and emerging computational architectures,
  including CPUs and GPUs.
abstract: libCEED is a new lightweight, open-source library for high-performance
  matrix-free Finite Element computations. libCEED offers a portable interface
  to high-performance implementations, selectable at runtime, tuned for a
  variety of current and emerging computational architectures, including CPUs
  and GPUs. libCEEDâ€™s interface is purely algebraic, facilitating co-design with
  vendors and enabling unintrusive integration in new and legacy software. In
  this work, we present libCEED's newly-available Python interface, which opens
  up new strategies for parallelism and scaling in high-performance Python,
  without compromising ease of use.
