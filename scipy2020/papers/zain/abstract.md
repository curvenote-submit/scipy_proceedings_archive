title: Towards an Unsupervised Spatiotemporal Representation of Cilia Video
  Using A Modular Generative Pipeline
description: Motile cilia are a highly conserved organelle found on the exterior
  of many human cells. Cilia beat in rhythmic patterns to transport substances
  or generate signaling gradients. Disruption of these patterns is often
  indicative of diseases known as ciliopathies, whose consequences can include
  dysfunction of macroscopic structures within the lungs, kidneys, brain, and
  other organs.
abstract: "Motile cilia are a highly conserved organelle found on the exterior
  of many human cells. Cilia beat in rhythmic patterns to transport substances
  or generate signaling gradients. Disruption of these patterns is often
  indicative of diseases known as ciliopathies, whose consequences can include
  dysfunction of macroscopic structures within the lungs, kidneys, brain, and
  other organs. Characterizing ciliary motion phenotypes as healthy or diseased
  is an essential step towards diagnosing and differentiating ciliopathies. We
  propose a modular generative pipeline for the analysis of cilia video data so
  that expert labor may be supplemented for this task. Our proposed model is
  divided into three modules: preprocessing, appearance, and dynamics. The
  preprocessing module augments the initial data, and its output is fed
  frame-by-frame into the generative appearance model which learns a compressed
  latent representation of the cilia. The frames are then embedded into the
  latent space as a low-dimensional path. This path is fed into the generative
  dynamics module, which focuses only on the motion of the cilia. Since both the
  appearance and dynamics modules are generative, the pipeline itself serves as
  an end-to-end generative model. This thorough and versatile model allows
  experts to spend less time caught in the minutiae of cilia biopsy analysis,
  while also enabling new insights by quantifying subtle patterns that would be
  otherwise difficult to categorize."
