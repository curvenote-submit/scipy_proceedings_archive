title: Netlist Analysis and Transformations Using SpyDrNet
description: Digital hardware circuits (i.e., for application specific
  integrated circuits or field programmable gate array circuits) can contain a
  large number of discrete components and connections. These connections are
  defined by a data structure called a \textquotedbl{}netlist\textquotedbl{}.
abstract: Digital hardware circuits (i.e., for application specific integrated
  circuits or field programmable gate array circuits) can contain a large number
  of discrete components and connections. These connections are defined by a
  data structure called a \textquotedbl{}netlist\textquotedbl{}. Important
  information can be gained by analyzing the structure of the circuit netlist
  and relationships between components. Many specific circuit manipulations
  require component reorganization in hierarchy and various circuit
  transformations. SpyDrNet is an open-source netlist analysis and
  transformation tool written in Python that performs many of these functions.
  SpyDrNet provides a framework for netlist representation, querying, and
  modification that is netlist format independent and generalized for use in a
  wide variety of applications. This tool is actively used to enhance circuit
  reliability and error detection for circuits operating in harsh radiation
  environments.
