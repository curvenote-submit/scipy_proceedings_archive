abstract: Pyvis is a Python module that enables visualizing and interactively
  manipulating network graphs in the Jupyter notebook, or as a standalone web
  application. Pyvis is built on top of the powerful and mature VisJS JavaScript
  library, which allows for fast and responsive interactions while also
  abstracting away the low-level JavaScript and HTML. This means that elements
  of the rendered graph visualization, such as node/edge attributes can be
  specified within Python and shipped to the JavaScript layer for VisJS to
  render. This declarative approach makes it easy to quickly explore graph
  visualizations and investigate data relationships. In addition, Pyvis is
  highly customizable so that colors, sizes, and hover tooltips can be assigned
  to the rendered graph. The network graph layout is controlled by a front-end
  physics engine that is configurable from a Python interface, allowing for the
  detailed placement of the graph elements. In this paper, we outline use cases
  for Pyvis with specific examples to highlight key features for any analysis
  workflow. A brief overview of Pyvis' implementation describes how the Python
  front-end binding uses simple Pyvis calls.
