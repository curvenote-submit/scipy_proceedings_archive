title: Introduction to Geometric Learning in Python with Geomstats
description: There is a growing interest in leveraging differential geometry in
  the machine learning community. Yet, the adoption of the associated geometric
  computations has been inhibited by the lack of a reference implementation.
abstract: "There is a growing interest in leveraging differential geometry in
  the machine learning community. Yet, the adoption of the associated geometric
  computations has been inhibited by the lack of a reference implementation.
  Such an implementation should typically allow its users: (i) to get intuition
  on concepts from differential geometry through a hands-on approach, often not
  provided by traditional textbooks; and (ii) to run geometric machine learning
  algorithms seamlessly, without delving into the mathematical details. To
  address this gap, we present the open-source Python package geomstats and
  introduce hands-on tutorials for differential geometry and geometric machine
  learning algorithms - Geometric Learning - that rely on it. Code and
  documentation: github.com/geomstats/geomstats and geomstats.ai."
