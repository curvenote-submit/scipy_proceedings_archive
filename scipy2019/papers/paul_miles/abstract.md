title: Parameter Estimation Using the Python Package pymcmcstat
description: A Bayesian approach to solving inverse problems provides insight
  regarding model limitations as well as the underlying model and observation
  uncertainty. In this paper we introduce pymcmcstat, which provides a wide
  variety of tools for estimating unknown parameter distributions.
abstract: A Bayesian approach to solving inverse problems provides insight
  regarding model limitations as well as the underlying model and observation
  uncertainty. In this paper we introduce pymcmcstat, which provides a wide
  variety of tools for estimating unknown parameter distributions. For
  scientists and engineers familiar with least-squares optimization, this
  package provides a similar interface from which to expand their analysis to a
  Bayesian framework. This package has been utilized in a wide array of
  scientific and engineering problems, including radiation source localization
  and constitutive model development of smart material systems.
