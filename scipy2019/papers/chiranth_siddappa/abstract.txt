The purpose of this project is to provide a real time geolocation solution by generating code for the complex ambiguity
function
(CAF) in a hardware description language (HDL) and the implementation on FPGA hardware.
The CAF has many practical applications, the more traditional being radar or sonar type systems.
By using scientific Python tools, this project provides a solution for testing signals and the ability to customize
modules to target multiple devices.
The processing for this implementation will be done on a PYNQ board designed by Xilinx.
The PYNQ board provides a Zynq chip which has both an ARM CPU and FPGA fabric.
All required mathematical operations for the CAF are returned to the user through Python classes which produce
synthesizable code in the Verilog HDL. The Python classes use Jinja templates integrated into the Verilog code to allow
for configuration changes that a user will need to change for investigation and simulation, development, and test.
Helper methods are included in the package to help simulation of the HDL such as quantization, complex data reading and
writing, and methods to verify the data using quantized values.
