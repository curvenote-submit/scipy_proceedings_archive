title: Expert RF Feature Extraction to Win the Army RCO AI Signal Classification
  Challenge
description: Automatic modulation classification is a challenging problem with
  multiple applications including cognitive radio and signals intelligence. Most
  of the existing efforts to solve this problem are only applicable when the
  signal to noise ratio (SNR) is high and/or long observations of the signal are
  available.
abstract: Automatic modulation classification is a challenging problem with
  multiple applications including cognitive radio and signals intelligence. Most
  of the existing efforts to solve this problem are only applicable when the
  signal to noise ratio (SNR) is high and/or long observations of the signal are
  available. Recent work has focused on applying shallow and deep machine
  learning (ML) to this problem. Feature generation, where raw signal
  information is transformed prior to attempting classification is a key part of
  this process. A big question that researchers face is whether to let the deep
  learning system infer the relevant features or build expert features based on
  expected signal characteristics. In this paper, we present novel signal
  feature extraction methods for use in signal classification via ML. The deep
  learning and combined approaches are discussed in a simultaneous publication.
  Expert features were utilized via ensemble leaning and shallow neural networks
  to win the Army Rapid Capability Office (RCO) 2018 Signal Classification
  Challenge. The features include both standard statistical measurements such as
  variance and kurtosis, as well as measurements tailored for specific waveform
  families. We discuss the best statistical descriptors along with a ranked list
  of signal features and discuss individual feature importance. We then
  demonstrate our implementation of these features and discuss effectiveness in
  estimating different modulation classes. The methods discussed when combined
  with deep learning are capable of correctly classifying waveforms at -10 dB
  SNR with over 63\% accuracy and signals at +10 dB SNR with over 95\% accuracy
  from an Army RCO provided training set.
