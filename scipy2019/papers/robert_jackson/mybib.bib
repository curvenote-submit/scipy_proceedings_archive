    abstract = { Abstract The utility of the anelastic vertical vorticity equation in a weak-constraint
     (least squares error) variational dual-Doppler wind analysis procedure is explored.
      The analysis winds are obtained by minimizing a cost function accounting for the discrepancies between
      observed and analyzed radial winds, errors in the mass conservation equation, errors in the anelastic
      vertical vorticity equation, and spatial smoothness constraints. By using Taylor’s frozen-turbulence
      hypothesis to shift analysis winds to observation points, discrepancies between radially projected
      analysis winds and radial wind observations can be calculated at the actual times and locations
      the data are acquired. The frozen-turbulence hypothesis is also used to evaluate the local derivative
      term in the vorticity equation. Tests of the analysis procedure are performed with analytical
      pseudo-observations of an array of translating and temporally decaying counterrotating updrafts and
      downdrafts generated from a Beltrami flow solution of the Navier–Stokes equations. The experiments
      explore the value added to the analysis by the vorticity equation constraint in the common scenario
      of substantial missing low-level data (radial wind observations at heights beneath 1.5 km are withheld
      from the analysis). Experiments focus on the sensitivity of the most sensitive analysis variable—the vertical
      velocity component—to values of the weighting coefficients, volume scan period, number of volume scans, and
      errors in the estimated frozen-turbulence pattern-translation components. Although the vorticity equation
      constraint is found to add value to many of these analyses, the analysis can become significantly degraded
      if estimates of the pattern-translation components are largely in error or if the frozen-turbulence hypothesis
      itself breaks down. However, tests also suggest that these negative impacts can be mitigated if data are
      available in a rapid-scan mode. }

    abstract = { Abstract A benchmark solution that facilitates testing the accuracy, efficiency, and efficacy of moist nonhydrostatic numerical model formulations and assumptions is presented. The solution is created from a special configuration of moist model processes and a specific set of initial conditions. The configuration and initial conditions include: reversible phase changes, no hydrometeor fallout, a neutrally stable base-state environment, and an initial buoyancy perturbation that is identical to the one used to test nonlinearly evolving dry thermals. The results of the moist simulation exhibit many of the properties found in its dry counterpart. Given the similar results, and acceptably small total mass and total energy errors, it is argued that this new moist simulation design can be used as a benchmark to evaluate moist numerical model formulations. The utility of the benchmark simulation is highlighted by running the case with approximate forms of the governing equations found in the literature. Results of these tests have implications for the formulation of numerical models. For example, it is shown that an equation set that conserves both mass and energy is crucial for obtaining the benchmark solution. Results also suggest that the extra effort required to conserve mass in a numerical model may not lead to significant improvements in results unless energy is also conserved. }

 are both economical and viable during and past the lifetime of the project. Public cloud computing services (e.g.,
 from Amazon, Microsoft, or Google) or private clouds managed by research institutions are providing object data
 storage systems potentially appropriate for long-term archives of such large geophysical data sets. We illustrate
 the use of a private cloud object store developed by the Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) at the
 University of Utah. Since early 2015, we have been archiving thousands of two-dimensional gridded fields
 (each one containing over 1.9 million values over the contiguous United States) from the High-Resolution
 Rapid Refresh (HRRR) data assimilation and forecast modeling system. The archive is being used for retrospective
 analyses of meteorological conditions during high-impact weather events, assessing the accuracy of the HRRR
 forecasts, and providing initial and boundary conditions for research simulations. The archive is accessible
 interactively and through automated download procedures for researchers at other institutions that can be
 tailored by the user to extract individual two-dimensional grids from within the highly compressed files.
 Characteristics of the CHPC object storage system are summarized relative to network file system storage or tape
 storage solutions. The CHPC storage system is proving to be a scalable, reliable, extensible, affordable, and usable
 archive solution for our research."}

    abstract = { AbstractOne of the greatest challenges to dual-Doppler retrieval of the vertical wind is the lack of
    low-level divergence information available to the mass conservation constraint. This study examines the impact of
    a vertical vorticity equation constraint on vertical velocity retrievals when radar observations are lacking near
    the ground. The analysis proceeds in a three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) framework with the
    anelastic form of the vertical vorticity equation imposed along with traditional data, mass conservation, and
    smoothness constraints. The technique is tested using emulated radial wind observations of a supercell storm
    simulated by the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), as well as real dual-Doppler observations of a
    supercell storm that occurred in Oklahoma on 8 May 2003. Special attention is given to procedures to evaluate
    the vorticity tendency term, including spatially variable advection correction and estimation of the intrinsic
    evolution. Volume scan times ranging from 5 min, typical of operational radar networks, down to 30 s, achievable
    by rapid-scan mobile radars, are considered. The vorticity constraint substantially improves the vertical velocity
    retrievals in our experiments, particularly for volume scan times smaller than 2 min. }
