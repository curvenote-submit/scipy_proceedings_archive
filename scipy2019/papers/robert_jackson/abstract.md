title: "PyDDA: A new Pythonic Wind Retrieval Package"
description: PyDDA is a new community framework aimed at wind retrievals that
  depends only upon utilities in the SciPy ecosystem such as scipy, numpy, and
  dask. It can support retrievals of winds using information from weather radar
  networks constrained by high resolution forecast models over grids that cover
  thousands of kilometers at kilometer-scale resolution.
abstract: PyDDA is a new community framework aimed at wind retrievals that
  depends only upon utilities in the SciPy ecosystem such as scipy, numpy, and
  dask. It can support retrievals of winds using information from weather radar
  networks constrained by high resolution forecast models over grids that cover
  thousands of kilometers at kilometer-scale resolution. Unlike past wind
  retrieval packages, this package can be installed using anaconda for easy
  installation and, with a focus on ease of use can retrieve winds from gridded
  radar and model data with just a few lines of code. The package is currently
  available for download at https://github.com/openradar/PyDDA.
