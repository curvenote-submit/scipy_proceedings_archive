title: Parkinson's Classification and Feature Extraction from Diffusion Tensor Images
description: Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects over 6.2 million people around the
  world. Despite its prevalence, there is still no cure, and diagnostic methods
  are extremely subjective, relying on observation of physical motor symptoms
  and response to treatment protocols.
abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects over 6.2 million people around the
  world. Despite its prevalence, there is still no cure, and diagnostic methods
  are extremely subjective, relying on observation of physical motor symptoms
  and response to treatment protocols. Other neurodegenerative diseases can
  manifest similar motor symptoms and often too much neuronal damage has
  occurred before motor symptoms can be observed. The goal of our study is to
  examine diffusion tensor images (DTI) from Parkinson’s and control patients
  through linear dynamical systems and tensor decomposition methods to generate
  features for training classification models. Diffusion tensor imaging
  emphasizes the spread and density of white matter in the brain. We will reduce
  the dimensionality of these images to allow us to focus on the key features
  that differentiate PD and control patients. We show through our experiments
  that these approaches can result in good classification accuracy (90\%), and
  indicate this avenue of research has a promising future.
