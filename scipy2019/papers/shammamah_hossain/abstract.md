abstract: Plotly's Dash is a library that empowers data scientists to create
  interactive web applications declaratively in Python. Dash Bio is a
  bioinformatics-oriented suite of components that are compatible with Dash.
  Visualizations of data that are often found in the field of bioinformatics can
  now be integrated into Dash applications. We present the Dash Bio suite of
  components and parts of an auxiliary library that contains tools that parse
  files from common bioinformatics databases.
