	abstract = {Concepts for an advanced pump limiter experiment able to exhaust 5–10\% of the plasma particle flux and remove 200 W/cm2 of heat flux on the limiter face are developed and analyzed. An axisymmetric toroidal belt limiter has a compound curvature blade with edges that extend one particle e-folding distance into the scrape-off layer plasma. Approximately 30\% of the plasma efflux flows in a gap between the bottom of the limiter blade and the top of either a structural floor, a plenum box or a liner. Neutralizer/deflector plates are located in discrete pairs at each pumping duct and are designed to optimally scatter neutralized particles into the pump ducts. An alternative design consists of a central toroidal spine beneath the blade which scatters plasma as neutral gas into a plenum box. For application to the TEXTOR tokamak with 1.5 MW of ICRF heating and 2.6 MW of 50 keV neutral beam injection, detailed analysis shows that an average heat flux is approximately 200 W/cm2 and that the localized collector plate design is about five times more efficient than the spinal design for particle removal.},

are discussed. The data in the database represent electron cyclotron heated (ECH) and neutral beam
injection (NBI) heated discharges in the L mode confinement regime. Results from enhanced
confinement regimes such as H mode will be reported elsewhere. Regression expressions for the energy
confinement time are given for the individual devices, for the subsets of heliotron/torsatrons and
shearless stellarators and for the combined dataset. The combined scaling ISS-95 is found to
describe satisfactorily a large tokamak L mode dataset. The aspects of comparing stellarator and
tokamak data are discussed on the basis of various scaling expressions. In order to make this
database available to interested colleagues, the structure of the database, which is described in
detail, is organized in a similar way as the ITER confinement databases},

The hydrogen recycling in front of the four limiter segments has been studied by means of a CCD-camera, which proved to be a good instrument to center the discharge for symmetric plasma-limiter contact. The composition of the neutral fluxes from the limiter have been measured: oxygen fluxes are about a factor of ten higher than the metal fluxes; within the error limits the composition does not change with varying limiter radius. Electron densities in the scrape-off layer away from the limiter have been determined by injecting an Li-atom beam from a thermal source and by observing its emission as a function of radius. Similar measurements have been made in front of the limiter with sputtered Cr and O atoms. Both methods gave for the magnetic surface of the limiter radius nc ≈ 1 × 1012/cm3. Infrared observations of a test limiter with a CCD-camera and a PbSe-detector have been performed to record the thermal loads. About 10\% of the input power flows to the limiter.},

The processes of impurity production are well explained in the case of metals in JET and other tokamaks, questions are still unanswered for light impurities, in particular concerning the chemical processes and molecular compounds.

	abstract = {Fueling with gas and pellet injection from several different locations has been used on the DIII-D tokamak to study core fueling and transport in H-mode and L-mode plasmas. Specific experiments have been carried out to examine the fueling efficiency into DIII-D H-mode plasmas that have periodic edge localized modes (ELMs). The fueling efficiency, defined as the total increase in number of plasma electrons divided by the number of input fuel atoms, is determined by measurements of plasma electron density profiles before and after a fueling pulse. We have found previously that there is a significantly higher fueling efficiency for pellets injected from the inner wall [J. Nucl. Mater. 290 (2001) 398] versus outside midplane pellet injection or gas puffing. In this study we extend this work to include the investigation of gas puffing from the same inner wall injection locations as the pellets to determine if a similar effect may exist. The mechanism for the improved pellet fueling from the inner wall is hypothesized to be a ∇B induced polarization of the pellet cloud leading to an E×B drift [Phys. Plasmas 7 (2000) 1968] in the major radius direction. The possibility of similar physics playing a role in gas puff fueling is examined in these experiments and does not appear to be a significant effect.},

and neon in the ASDEX Upgrade divertor tokamak is presented. Strong turbomolecular pumps connected
to the divertor region allow effective pumping of all these gases.

Deuterium, however, is pumped effectively by the carbon walls in ASDEX Upgrade which dominate over
the external pumping.

Noble gases are hardly pumped by the walls, and their pumping efficiency and exhaust rate depends
strongly on their respective density in the divertor chamber, i.e. on the effectivity of scrape-off
layer transport and divertor retention. Compression of helium and neon in the divertor chamber
increases with the divertor neutral gas density, and in high-power, high-density discharges in H- or
CDH-mode pumping is very efficient. Helium exhaust in these scenarios is sufficiently fast to
fulfill the requirements for ITER or a fusion reactor.},

	abstract = {This review paper addresses the physics of stochastic boundaries. Although it is focused on the
tokamak configuration many features are common to the stochastic boundaries of stellarators. The
stochastic properties of magnetic field lines are recalled and related to the spectrum of the radial
magnetic perturbation. The stochastic region, referred to as the divertor volume, is shown to be
bounded to the edge plasma. Furthermore, the stochastic features discriminate two regions. On short
scales, the stochasticity is not effective and parallel transport dominates, this defines the
laminar region. On the long scales one recovers the proper stochastic features which characterize
the ergodic regime. Theoretical predictions for the transport of energy, current and particles in
the divertor volume are analysed for both the laminar and ergodic regimes. A strong increase in
electron transport is expected which should lead to a strong increase in the heat diffusivity, a
strong increase in the resistivity in the toroidal direction and generally a decrease in the free
electron lifetime in the divertor volume. Ambipolarity of particle transport is ensured by a radial
electric field. The ion transport, i.e. particle transport, is then more difficult to analyse since
one has to consider the strong coupling to the electron temperature field and to the electric
potential field. The perturbation level is such that the particle transport induced by the
stochasticity remains comparable to the anomalous transport. The experimental data show good
agreement with the predictions on electron transport. This translates into a flattening of the edge
temperature gradient, a narrowing of the current channel, which probably governs the observed
stabilization of MHD activity, and a strong decrease in the lifetime of the runaway electrons.
Regarding particle transport, the response is larger than expected and stochastic boundaries are
characterized by significant screening properties compared to limiter shots. This property is shown
to be a signature of a pumping capability combined with a change of transport properties. Indeed the
transport of neutrals is changed since the ratio of the ionization scales to the distance between
the recycling surfaces and the separatrix is reduced. Furthermore, a decreased lifetime of the ions
at the very edge of the plasma is expected. Screening effects are thus observed for species
exhibiting large wall pumping capability, while He and Ne are weakly affected by the stochastic
boundary. The plasma properties in the ergodic volume, namely a reduced edge temperature, an
increased impurity radiation, an efficient particle screening and the stabilization of MHD activity,
have opened the way to radiating layer investigations on Tore Supra. Stable operation has been
achieved with 80\% of radiated power and radio frequency heating up to 6 MW.},

	abstract = {A spectroscopic analysis of the deuterium Dα line (λ = 6561.0 Å) emitted in the edge of Tore-Supra
just in front of the equatorial neutralizer plate of the ergodic divertor is presented. This
analysis, which relies on a line shape modelling, is focused on asymmetric Dα spectra which are
obtained in some diverted discharges. It will be shown that three populations of neutrals
are necessary to interpret such spectra. A cold atoms population results from the dissociation of
molecules desorbed from the surface, and a warm one from charge-exchange reactions with the plasma
ions. The last population of neutrals is produced by normal reflection of plasma ions on the
neutralizer V-shaped notches {\textbackslash}mbox\{(V-points)\} and has an anisotropic velocity distribution
function. The anisotropy of this velocity distribution function is due to its initial form and to
its partial relaxation by neutral-ion elastic collisions. The analysis based on a line shape fitting
program including a relaxation model allows one to estimate the relative contributions of the
neutral populations of recycled deuterium to the Dα emission and their Doppler temperatures.
Finally, the dependence of the ion and neutral temperatures deduced from the fits and the dominant
molecular dissociation channels are discussed as a function of the edge electron density and
temperature.},

	abstract = {During the first operational phase (referred to as OP1.1) of the new Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)
stellarator, five poloidal graphite limiters were mounted on the inboard side of the vacuum vessel,
one in each of the five toroidal modules which form the W7-X vacuum vessel. Each limiter consisted
of nine specially shaped graphite tiles, designed to conform to the last closed field line geometry
in the bean-shaped section of the standard OP1.1 magnetic field configuration (Sunn Pedersen et al
2015 Nucl. Fusion 55 126001). We observed the limiters with multiple infrared and visible camera
systems, as well as filtered photomultipliers. Power loads are calculated from infrared (IR)
temperature measurements using THEODOR, and heating patterns (dual stripes) compare well with field
line mapping and EMC3-EIRENE predictions. While the poloidal symmetry of the heat loads was
excellent, the toroidal heating pattern showed up to a factor of 2×  variation, with peak heat loads
on Limiter 1. The total power intercepted by the limiters was up to {\textasciitilde}60\% of the input ECRH heating
power. Calorimetry using bulk tile heating (measured via post-shot IR thermography) on Limiter 3
showed a difference between short high power discharges, and longer lower power ones, with regards
to the fraction of energy deposited on the limiters. Finally, fast heating transients, with
frequency  {\textgreater}1 kHz were detected, and their visibility was enhanced by the presence of surface
coatings which developed on the limiters by the end of the campaign.},

	abstract = {Abstract
We document the variability in atomic oxygen inferred by the Sounding of the Atmosphere with Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the NASA/TIMED satellite in the lower mesosphere (50–80 km altitude) according to its diurnal, latitudinal, seasonal and solar cycle components. The dominant variation is diurnal and latitudinal. Below 75 km, seasonal and solar cycle effects are less than 5\%. Accordingly, we have developed a simple climatology that depends upon local time and latitude and applied it to a model of the D region of the ionosphere. Between 60 and 70 km, atomic oxygen is important in governing the ratio of negative ions to electrons. Using the SABER O climatology along with a previously published climatology of nitric oxide based upon UARS/HALOE data, we compare our model results both to previous calculations and to a profile of electron density [e−] acquired by a rocket launched from Kwajalein Atoll. The model results are shown to be consistent with previously published calculations, but the comparison with the data reveals a dramatic discrepancy whereby the calculated [e−] is over an order of magnitude less than the observations below 65 km. The most plausible explanation involves changing the partition of negative charge between molecules such as O2 which rapidly dissociate in sunlight versus heavier, more stable negative ions. Although observations of [e−] below 70 km are difficult and infrequent, more research should be invested to evaluate the pervasiveness and the seasonal, latitudinal and diurnal morphology of this model [e−] deficit. This may have practical implications as empirical models of the ionosphere predict a secondary maximum in HF radio absorption in the 70 km altitude region.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised learning of time series data, also known as temporal clustering, is a challenging problem in machine learning. Here we propose a novel algorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), to naturally integrate dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into a single end-to-end learning framework, fully unsupervised. The algorithm utilizes an autoencoder for temporal dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. Then it jointly optimizes the clustering objective and the dimensionality reduction objective. Based on requirement and application, the temporal clustering layer can be customized with any temporal similarity metric. Several similarity metrics and state-of-the-art algorithms are considered and compared. To gain insight into temporal features that the network has learned for its clustering, we apply a visualization method that generates a region of interest heatmap for the time series. The viability of the algorithm is demonstrated using time series data from diverse domains, ranging from earthquakes to spacecraft sensor data. In each case, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional methods. The superior performance is attributed to the fully integrated temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criterion.},

In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

NESAP for Data focuses on applications that process and analyze high-volume, high-velocity data sets from experimental or observational science (EOS) facilities supported by the US Department of Energy Office of Science. We present three case study applications from NESAP for Data that use Python. These codes vary in terms of “Python purity” from applications developed in pure Python to ones that use Python mainly as a convenience layer for scientists without expertise in lower level programming languages like C, C++ or Fortran. The science case, requirements, constraints, algorithms, and initial performance optimizations for each code are discussed. Our goal with this paper is to contribute to the larger conversation around the role of Python in high-performance computing today and tomorrow, highlighting areas for future work and emerging best practices.},

	abstract = {Rare sound event detection is a newly proposed task in IEEE DCASE 2017 to identify the presence of monophonic sound event that is classiﬁed as an emergency and to detect the onset time of the event. In this paper, we introduce a rare sound event detection system using combination of 1D convolutional neural network (1D ConvNet) and recurrent neural network (RNN) with long shortterm memory units (LSTM). A log-amplitude mel-spectrogram is used as an input acoustic feature and the 1D ConvNet is applied in each time-frequency frame to convert the spectral feature. Then the RNN-LSTM is utilized to incorporate the temporal dependency of the extracted features. The system is evaluated using DCASE 2017 Challenge Task 2 Dataset. Our best result on the test set of the development dataset shows 0.07 and 96.26 of error rate and F-score on the event-based metric, respectively. The proposed system has achieved the 1st place in the challenge with an error rate of 0.13 and an F-Score of 93.1 on the evaluation dataset.},

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classiﬁcation and detection.},
