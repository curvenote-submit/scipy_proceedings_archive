title: "pyjanitor: A Cleaner API for Cleaning Data"
description: The pandas library has become the de facto library for data
  wrangling in the Python programming language. However, inconsistencies in the
  pandas application programming interface (API), while idiomatic due to
  historical use, prevent use of expressive, fluent programming idioms that
  enable self-documenting pandas code.
abstract: The pandas library has become the de facto library for data wrangling
  in the Python programming language. However, inconsistencies in the pandas
  application programming interface (API), while idiomatic due to historical
  use, prevent use of expressive, fluent programming idioms that enable
  self-documenting pandas code. Here, we introduce pyjanitor, an open source
  Python package that extends the pandas API with such idioms. We describe its
  design and implementation of the package, provide usage examples from a
  variety of domains, and discuss the ways that the pyjanitor project has
  enabled the inclusion of first-time contributors to open source projects.
