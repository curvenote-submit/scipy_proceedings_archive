abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative
  condition originating in subcortical areas of the brain and resulting in
  progressively worsening motor, cognitive, and psychiatric (e.g., depression)
  symptoms. Neuroimage data is an attractive research tool given the
  neurophysiological origins of the disease. Despite insights potentially
  available in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, developing sound
  analytical techniques for this data has proven difficult. Principally,
  multiple image modalities are needed to compile the most accurate view
  possible; the process of incorporating multiple image modalities into a single
  holistic model is both poorly defined and extremely challenging. In this
  paper, we address these issues through the proposition of a novel graph-based
  convolutional neural network (GCN) architecture and present an end-to-end
  pipeline for preprocessing, formatting, and analyzing multimodal neuroimage
  data. We employ our pipeline on data downloaded from the Parkinson's
  Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Our GCN model outperforms
  baseline models, and uniquely allows for direct interpretation of its results.
