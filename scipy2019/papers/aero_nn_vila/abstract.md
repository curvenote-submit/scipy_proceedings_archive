title: Deep and Ensemble Learning to Win the Army RCO AI Signal Classification
  Challenge
description: Automatic modulation classification is a challenging problem with
  multiple applications including cognitive radio and signals intelligence. Most
  of the existing efforts to solve this problem are only applicable when the
  signal to noise ratio (SNR) is high and/or long observations of the signal are
  available.
abstract: Automatic modulation classification is a challenging problem with
  multiple applications including cognitive radio and signals intelligence. Most
  of the existing efforts to solve this problem are only applicable when the
  signal to noise ratio (SNR) is high and/or long observations of the signal are
  available. Recent work has focused on applying shallow and deep machine
  learning (ML) to this problem. In this paper, we present an exploration of
  such deep learning and ensemble learning techniques that was used to win the
  Army Rapid Capability Office (RCO) 2018 Signal Classification Challenge. An
  expert feature extraction and shallow learning approach is discussed in a
  simultaneous publication. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art deep learning
  network architectures and adapted them to work in the RF signal domain instead
  of the image/computer-vision domain. The best deep learning methods were
  merged with the best expert feature extraction and shallow learning methods
  using ensemble learning. Finally, the ensemble classifier was calibrated to
  obtain marginal gains. The methods discussed are capable of correctly
  classifying waveforms at -10 dB SNR with over 63\% accuracy and signals at +10
  dB SNR with over 95\% accuracy from an Army RCO provided training set.
