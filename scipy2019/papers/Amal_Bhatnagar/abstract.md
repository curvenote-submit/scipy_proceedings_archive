title: Accelerating the Advancement of Data Science Education
description: We outline a synthesis of strategies created in collaboration with
  35+ colleges and universities on how to advance undergraduate data science
  education on a national scale. The four core pillars of this strategy include
  the integration of data science education across all domains, establishing
  adoptable and scalable cyberinfrastructure, applying data science to
  non-traditional domains, and incorporating ethical content into data science
  curricula.
abstract: We outline a synthesis of strategies created in collaboration with 35+
  colleges and universities on how to advance undergraduate data science
  education on a national scale. The four core pillars of this strategy include
  the integration of data science education across all domains, establishing
  adoptable and scalable cyberinfrastructure, applying data science to
  non-traditional domains, and incorporating ethical content into data science
  curricula. The paper analyzes UC Berkeleyâ€™s method of accelerating the
  national advancement of data science education in undergraduate institutions
  and examines the recent innovations in autograders for assignments which helps
  scale such programs. The conversation of ethical practices with data science
  are key to mitigate social issues arising from computing, such as
  incorporating anti-bias algorithms. Following these steps will form the basis
  of a scalable data science education system that prepares undergraduate
  students with analytical skills for a data-centric world.
