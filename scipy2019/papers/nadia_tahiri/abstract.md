abstract: A grocery list is an integral part of the shopping experience of many
  consumers. Several mobile retail studies of grocery apps indicate that
  potential customers place the highest priority on features that help them to
  create and manage personalized shopping lists. First, we propose a new machine
  learning model written in Python 3 that predicts which grocery products the
  consumer will buy again or will try to buy for the first time, and in which
  store(s) the purchase will be made. Second, we introduce a smart shopping
  template to provide consumers with a personalized weekly shopping list based
  on their shopping history and known preferences. As the explanatory variables,
  we used available grocery shopping history, weekly product promotion
  information for a given region, as well as the product price statistics.
