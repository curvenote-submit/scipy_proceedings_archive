abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes more widely known and popular, so too
  does the desire for new users from other backgrounds to apply ML techniques to
  their own domains. A difficult prerequisite that often confounds new users is
  the feature creation and engineering process. This is especially true when
  users attempt to apply ML to domains that have not historically received
  attention from the ML community (e.g., outside of text, images, and audio).
  The Lempel Ziv Jaccard Distance (LZJD) is a compression based technique that
  can be used for many machine learning tasks. Because of its compression
  background, users do not need to specify any feature extraction, making it
  easy to apply to new domains. We introduce PyLZJD, a library that implements
  LZJD in a manner meant to be easy to use and apply for novice practitioners.
  We will discuss the intuition and high-level mechanics behind LZJD, followed
  by examples of how to use it on problems of disparate data types.
