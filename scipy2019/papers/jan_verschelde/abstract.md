  The solutions of a system of polynomials in several variables are often
  needed, e.g.: in the design of mechanical systems, and in phase-space analyses
  of nonlinear biological dynamics. Reliable, accurate, and comprehensive
  numerical solutions are available through PHCpack, a FOSS package for solving
  polynomial systems with homotopy continuation.


  This paper explores new developments in phcpy, a scripting interface for
  PHCpack, over the past five years. For instance, phcpy is now available online
  through a JupyterHub server featuring Python2, Python3, and SageMath kernels.
  As small systems are solved in real-time by phcpy, they are suitable for
  interactive exploration through the notebook interface. Meanwhile, phcpy
  supports GPU parallelization, improving the speed and quality of solutions to
  much larger polynomial systems. From various model design and analysis
  problems in STEM, certain classes of polynomial system frequently arise, to
  which phcpy is well-suited.
