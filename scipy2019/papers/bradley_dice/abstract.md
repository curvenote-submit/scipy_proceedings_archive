abstract: The freud Python library analyzes particle data output from molecular
  dynamics simulations. The library's design and its variety of high-performance
  methods make it a powerful tool for many modern applications. In particular,
  freud can be used as part of the data generation pipeline for machine learning
  (ML) algorithms for analyzing particle simulations, and it can be easily
  integrated with various simulation visualization tools for simultaneous
  visualization and real-time analysis. Here, we present numerous examples both
  of using freud to analyze nano-scale particle systems by coupling traditional
  simulational analyses to machine learning libraries and of visualizing
  per-particle quantities calculated by freud analysis methods. We include code
  and examples of this visualization, showing that in general the introduction
  of freud into existing ML and visualization workflows is smooth and
  unintrusive. We demonstrate that among Python packages used in the
  computational molecular sciences, freud offers a unique set of analysis
  methods with efficient computations and seamless coupling into powerful data
  analysis pipelines.
