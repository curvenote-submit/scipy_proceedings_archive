	Abstract = {A common measure of conformational similarity in structural bioinformatics is the minimum root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the coordinates of two macromolecules. In many applications, the rotations relating the structures are not needed. Several common algorithms for calculating RMSDs require the computationally costly procedures of determining either the eigen decomposition or matrix inversion of a 3x3 or 4x4 matrix. Using a quaternion-based method, here a simple algorithm is developed that rapidly and stably determines RMSDs by circumventing the decomposition and inversion problems.},

	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations capture the behavior of biological macromolecules in full atomic detail, but their computational demands, combined with the challenge of appropriately modeling the relevant physics, have historically restricted their length and accuracy. Dramatic recent improvements in achievable simulation speed and the underlying physical models have enabled atomic-level simulations on timescales as long as milliseconds that capture key biochemical processes such as protein folding, drug binding, membrane transport, and the conformational changes critical to protein function. Such simulation may serve as a computational microscope, revealing biomolecular mechanisms at spatial and temporal scales that are difficult to observe experimentally. We describe the rapidly evolving state of the art for atomic-level biomolecular simulation, illustrate the types of biological discoveries that can now be made through simulation, and discuss challenges motivating continued innovation in this field.},

@article{Mura:2014kx,
	Abstract = { The biomolecules in and around a living cell -- proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates -- continuously sample myriad conformational states that are thermally accessible at physiological temperatures. Simultaneously, a given biomolecule also samples (and is sampled by) a rapidly fluctuating local environment comprising other biopolymers, small molecules, water, ions, etc. that diffuse to within a few nanometres, leading to inter-molecular contacts that stitch together large supramolecular assemblies. Indeed, all biological systems can be viewed as dynamic networks of molecular interactions. As a complement to experimentation, molecular simulation offers a uniquely powerful approach to analyse biomolecular structure, mechanism and dynamics; this is possible because the molecular contacts that define a complicated biomolecular system are governed by the same physical principles (forces and energetics) that characterise individual small molecules, and these simpler systems are relatively well-understood. With modern algorithms and computing capabilities, simulations are now an indispensable tool for examining biomolecular assemblies in atomic detail, from the conformational motion in an individual protein to the diffusional dynamics and inter-molecular collisions in the early stages of formation of cellular-scale assemblies such as the ribosome. This text introduces the physicochemical foundations of molecular simulations and docking, largely from the perspective of biomolecular interactions. },

The growth reflects an emerging need to understand microscopic physical and chemical processes, which are fundamental to further improve the macroscopic performance of construction materials. Nano-engineering, as a concept about manipulating material structures for creating new materials or modifying existing materials, highly depends on the understanding of materials at the nanoscale, where molecular dynamics simulation becomes an effective and powerful investigation tool. In this paper, the applications of molecular dynamics simulations in understanding the fundamental deformation mechanism of various construction materials including concrete and cement, fiber-reinforced polymers and related bonded systems upon nano-engineering approach are presented. In addition, the study on nature materials towards their structural morphology and functions at the atomistic level is illustrated so as to inspire the future development of advanced construction materials. The challenges and innovations associated with nano-engineering are also discussed.},

The large number of building blocks required to define a nanostructure combined with the many degrees of freedom in packing small molecules has long precluded molecular simulations, but recent advances in computational hardware as well as software have made classical simulations available to this strongly expanding field. Here, we review the state of the art in simulations of self-assembling bio-inspired supramolecular systems. We will first discuss progress in force fields, simulation protocols and enhanced sampling techniques using recent examples. Secondly, we will focus on efforts to enable the comparison of experimentally accessible observables and computational results. Experimental quantities that can be measured by microscopy, spectroscopy and scattering can be linked to simulation output either directly or indirectly, via quantum mechanical or semi-empirical techniques. Overall, we aim to provide an overview of the various computational approaches to understand not only the molecular architecture of nanostructures, but also the mechanism of their formation.},

creep, physical aging, strain hardening and crazing. Simulations reproduce most of
the macroscopic features of plasticity in polymer glasses such as stress--strain
relations and creep response, and reveal information about the underlying atomistic
processes. Trends of the shear yield stress with loading conditions, temperature
and strain rate, and the atomistic dynamics under load have been systematically
explored. Most polymers undergo physical aging, which leads to a history-dependent
mechanical response. Simulations of strain hardening and crazing demonstrate the
nature of polymer entanglements in the glassy state and the role of local plasticity

	Abstract = { The nucleation of crystals in liquids is one of nature's most ubiquitous phenomena, playing an important role in areas such as climate change and the production of drugs. As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly small time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique insights into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the most pressing open questions in the field. We believe that, by improving (i) existing interatomic potentials and (ii) currently available enhanced sampling methods, the community can move toward accurate investigations of realistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step closer to experiments. },

These simulations appear poised to exert a significant impact on how new drugs are found, perhaps even transforming the very process of drug discovery. We predict here future results we can expect from, and enhancements we need to make in, molecular dynamics simulations over the coming 25 years, and in so doing set out several Grand Challenges for the field. In the context of the problems now facing the pharmaceutical industry, we ask how we can best address drug discovery needs of the next quarter century using molecular dynamics simulations, and we suggest some possible approaches.},

	Abstract = {Biomolecular simulation is increasingly central to understanding and designing biological molecules and their interactions. Detailed, physics-based simulation methods are demonstrating rapidly growing impact in areas as diverse as biocatalysis, drug delivery, biomaterials, biotechnology, and drug design. Simulations offer the potential of uniquely detailed, atomic-level insight into mechanisms, dynamics, and processes, as well as increasingly accurate predictions of molecular properties. Simulations can now be used as computational assays of biological activity, for example, in predictions of drug resistance. Methodological and algorithmic developments, combined with advances in computational hardware, are transforming the scope and range of calculations. Different types of methods are required for different types of problem. Accurate methods and extensive simulations promise quantitative comparison with experiments across biochemistry. Atomistic simulations can now access experimentally relevant timescales for large systems, leading to a fertile interplay of experiment and theory and offering unprecedented opportunities for validating and developing models. Coarse-grained methods allow studies on larger length- and timescales, and theoretical developments are bringing electronic structure calculations into new regimes. Multiscale methods are another key focus for development, combining different levels of theory to increase accuracy, aiming to connect chemical and molecular changes to macroscopic observables. In this review, we outline biomolecular simulation methods and highlight examples of its application to investigate questions in biology.

This has been enabled by access to large scale and heterogeneous high performance computing resources, including special purpose hardware. The improved performance of modern simulation methods coupled with hardware advances is shifting the rate-limiting steps of common biomolecular simulations of small- to moderately-sized systems from the generation of data (for example via production molecular dynamics simulations that used to take weeks or even months) to the pre- and post-processing phases of the workflow, namely simulation set-up and data processing, management, and analysis.

	Abstract = {MDAnalysis (http://mdanalysis.org) is a library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. MD simulations of biological molecules have become an important tool to elucidate the relationship between molecular structure and physiological function. Simulations are performed with highly optimized software packages on HPC resources but most codes generate output trajectories in their own formats so that the development of new trajectory analysis algorithms is confined to specific user communities and widespread adoption and further development is delayed. MDAnalysis addresses this problem by abstracting access to the raw simulation data and presenting a uniform object-oriented Python interface to the user. It thus enables users to rapidly write code that is portable and immediately usable in virtually all biomolecular simulation communities. The user interface and modular design work equally well in complex scripted work flows, as foundations for other packages, and for interactive and rapid prototyping work in IPython / Jupyter notebooks, especially together with molecular visualization provided by nglview and time series analysis with pandas. MDAnalysis is written in Python and Cython and uses NumPy arrays for easy interoperability with the wider scientific Python ecosystem. It is widely used and forms the foundation for more specialized biomolecular simulation tools. MDAnalysis is available under the GNU General Public License v2. },

@inproceedings{Khoshlessan:2017ab,
	Abstract = {The analysis of biomolecular computer simulations has become a challenge because the amount of output data is now routinely in the terabyte range. We evaluated if this challenge can be met by a parallel map-reduce approach with the Dask parallel computing library for task-graph based com- puting coupled with our MDAnalysis Python library for the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We performed a representative performance evalu- ation, taking into account the highly heterogeneous computing environment that researchers typically work in together with the diversity of existing file formats for MD trajectory data. We found that the underlying storage system (solid state drives, parallel file systems, or simple spinning platter disks) can be a deciding performance factor that leads to data ingestion becoming the primary bottleneck in the analysis work flow. However, the choice of the data file format can mitigate the effect of the storage system; in particular, the commonly used Gromacs XTC trajectory format, which is highly compressed, can exhibit strong scaling close to ideal due to trading a decrease in global storage access load against an increase in local per-core CPU-intensive decompression. Scaling was tested on a single node and multiple nodes on national and local supercomputing resources as well as typical workstations. Although very good strong scaling could be achieved for single nodes, good scaling across multiple nodes was hindered by the persistent occurrence of "stragglers", tasks that take much longer than all other tasks, and whose ultimate cause could not be completely ascertained. In summary, we show that, due to the focus on high interoperability in the scientific Python eco system, it is straightforward to implement map-reduce with Dask in MDAnalysis and provide an in-depth analysis of the considerations to obtain good parallel performance on HPC resources.},
