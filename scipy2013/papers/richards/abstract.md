  There is evidence to suggest that a surprising proportion of published
  experiments in science are difficult if not impossible to reproduce. The
  concepts of data sharing, leaving an audit trail and extensive documentation
  are fundamental to reproducible research, whether it is in the laboratory or
  as part of an analysis. In this work, we introduce a tool for documentation
  that aims to make analyses more reproducible in the general scientific
  community.


  The application, lpEdit, is a cross-platform editor, written with PyQt4, that
  enables a broad range of scientists to carry out the analytic component of
  their work in a reproducible manner—through the use of literate programming.
  Literate programming mixes code and prose to produce a final report that reads
  like an article or book. lpEdit targets researchers getting started with
  statistics or programming, so the hurdles associated with setting up a proper
  pipeline are kept to a minimum and the learning burden is reduced through the
  use of templates and documentation. The documentation for lpEdit is centered
  around learning by example, and accordingly we use several increasingly
  involved examples to demonstrate the software’s capabilities.


  We first consider applications of lpEdit to process analyses mixing R and
  Python code with the documentation system. Finally, we illustrate the use of
  lpEdit to conduct a reproducible functional analysis of high-throughput
  sequencing data, using the transcriptome of the butterfly species Pieris
  brassicae.
