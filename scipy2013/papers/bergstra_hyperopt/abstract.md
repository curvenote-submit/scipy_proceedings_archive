title: "Hyperopt: A Python Library for Optimizing the Hyperparameters of Machine
  Learning Algorithms"
description: Sequential model-based optimization (also known as Bayesian
  optimization) is one of the most efficient methods (per function evaluation)
  of function minimization. This efficiency makes it appropriate for optimizing
  the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms that are slow to train.
abstract: Sequential model-based optimization (also known as Bayesian
  optimization) is one of the most efficient methods (per function evaluation)
  of function minimization. This efficiency makes it appropriate for optimizing
  the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms that are slow to train. The
  Hyperopt library provides algorithms and parallelization infrastructure for
  performing hyperparameter optimization (model selection) in Python. This paper
  presents an introductory tutorial on the usage of the Hyperopt library,
  including the description of search spaces, minimization (in serial and
  parallel), and the analysis of the results collected in the course of
  minimization. The paper closes with some discussion of ongoing and future
  work.
