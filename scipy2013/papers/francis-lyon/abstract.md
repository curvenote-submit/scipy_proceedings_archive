title: Detection and characterization of interactions of genetic risk factors in
  disease
description: It is well known that two or more genes can interact so as to
  enhance or suppress incidence of disease, such that the observed phenotype
  differs from when the genes act independently. The effect of a gene allele at
  one locus can mask or modify the effect of alleles at one or more other loci.

  It is well known that two or more genes can interact so as to enhance or
  suppress incidence of disease, such that the observed phenotype differs from
  when the genes act independently. The effect of a gene allele at one locus can
  mask or modify the effect of alleles at one or more other loci. Discovery and
  characterization of such gene interactions is pursued as a valuable aid in
  early diagnosis and treatment of disease. Also it is hoped that the
  characterization of such interactions will shed light on biological and
  biochemical pathways that are involved in a specific disease, leading to new
  therapeutic treatments.


  Much attention has been focused on the application of machine learning
  approaches to detection of gene interactions. Our method is based upon
  training a supervised learning algorithm to detect disease, and then
  quantifying the effect on prediction accuracy when alleles of two or more
  genes are perturbed to unmutated in patterns so as to reveal and characterize
  gene interactions. We utilize this approach with a support vector machine.


  We test the versatility of our approach using seven disease models, some of
  which model gene interactions and some of which model biological independence.
  In every disease model we correctly detect the presence or absence of 2-way
  and 3-way gene interactions using our method. We also correctly characterize
  all of the interactions as to the epistatic effect of gene alleles in both
  2-way and 3-way gene interactions. This provides evidence that this machine
  learning approach can be used to successfully detect and also characterize
  gene interactions in disease.
