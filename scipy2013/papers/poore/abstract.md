abstract: PythonTeX is a LaTeX package that allows Python code in a LaTeX
  document to be executed. This makes possible reproducible documents that
  combine analysis with the code required to perform it. Writing such documents
  can be more efficient because code is adjacent to its output. Writing is also
  less error-prone since results may be accessed directly from within the
  document, without copy-and-pasting. This paper provides an overview of
  PythonTeX, including Python output caching, dependency tracking,
  synchronization of errors and warnings with the LaTeX document, conversion of
  documents to other formats, and support for languages beyond Python. These
  features are illustrated through an extended, step-by-step example of
  reproducible analysis performed with PythonTeX.
