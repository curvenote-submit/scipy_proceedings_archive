  Modern research projects incorporate data from several sources, and new
  insights are increasingly driven by the ability to interpret data in the
  context of other data. Glue is an interactive environment built on top of the
  standard Python science stack to visualize relationships within and between
  datasets. With Glue, users can load and visualize multiple related datasets
  simultaneously. Users specify the logical connections that exist between data,
  and Glue transparently uses this information as needed to enable visualization
  across files. This functionality makes it trivial, for example, to
  interactively overplot catalogs on top of images.


  The central philosophy behind Glue is that the structure of research data is
  highly customized and problem-specific. Glue aims to accommodate this and
  simplify the "data munging" process, so that
  researchers can more naturally explore what their data have to say. The result
  is a cleaner scientific workflow, faster interaction with data, and an easier
  avenue to insight.
