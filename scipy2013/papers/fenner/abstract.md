title: Automating Quantitative Confocal Microscopy Analysis
description: "Quantitative confocal microscopy is a powerful analytical tool
  used to visualize the associations between cellular processes and anatomical
  structures. In our biological experiments, we use quantitative confocal
  microscopy to study the association of three cellular components: binding
  proteins, receptors, and organelles."
abstract: "Quantitative confocal microscopy is a powerful analytical tool used
  to visualize the associations between cellular processes and anatomical
  structures. In our biological experiments, we use quantitative confocal
  microscopy to study the association of three cellular components: binding
  proteins, receptors, and organelles. We propose an automated method that will
  (1) reduce the time consuming effort of manual background correction and (2)
  compute numerical coefficients to associate cellular process with structure.
  The project is implemented, end-to-end, in Python. Pure Python is used for
  managing file access, input parameters, and initial processing of the
  repository of 933 images. NumPy is used to apply manual background correction,
  to compute the automated background corrections, and to calculate the domain
  specific coefficients. We visualize the raw intensity values and computed
  coefficient values with Tufte-style panel plots created in matplotlib. A
  longer term goal of this work is to explore plausible extensions of our
  automated methods to triple-label coefficients."
