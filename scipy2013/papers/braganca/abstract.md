title: Using Python to Study Rotational Velocity Distributions of Hot Stars
description: Stars are fundamental pieces that compose our Universe. By studying
  them we can better comprehend the environment in which we live. In this work,
  we have studied a sample of 350 nearby O and B stars and have characterized
  them in aspects of their multiplicity, temperature, spectral classifications,
  and projected rotational velocity.

  Python is a robust language with a steep learning curve, i.e. one can make
  rapid progress with it. In this proceeding, we will present how we used Python
  in our research.
