title: Modeling the Earth with Fatiando a Terra
description: Geophysics is the science of using physical observations of the
  Earth to infer its inner structure. Generally, this is done with a variety of
  numerical modeling techniques and inverse problems. The development of new
  algorithms usually involves copy and pasting of code, which leads to errors
  and poor code reuse.
abstract: Geophysics is the science of using physical observations of the Earth
  to infer its inner structure. Generally, this is done with a variety of
  numerical modeling techniques and inverse problems. The development of new
  algorithms usually involves copy and pasting of code, which leads to errors
  and poor code reuse. Fatiando a Terra is a Python library that aims to
  automate common tasks and unify the modeling pipeline inside of the Python
  language. This allows users to replace the traditional shell scripting with
  more versatile and powerful Python scripting. The library can also be used as
  an API for developing stand-alone programs. Algorithms implemented in Fatiando
  a Terra can be combined to build upon existing functionality. This flexibility
  facilitates prototyping of new algorithms and quickly building interactive
  teaching exercises. In the future, we plan to continuously implement sample
  problems to help teach geophysics as well as classic and state-of-the-art
  algorithms.
