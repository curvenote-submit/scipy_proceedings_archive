SciPy 2013, the twelfth annual Scientific Computing with Python
conference, was held June 24th-29th 2013 in Austin, Texas, USA. SciPy
is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing
through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and
engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from
academic, commercial, and governmental organizations to showcase their
newest tools and technics, learn from skilled users and developers,
and collaborate on code development. These tools most often involve
lower level languages but are characterized by a common goal of
exposing most functionalities to Python users to maximize efficiency
and simplicity of usage.

This 12th edition has seen an amazing surge in attendance, with people
from 5 continents, while retaining the great collaborative and
friendly atmosphere that has characterized SciPy conferences over the
years. Among many other improvements, this edition has seen a big push
in making the proceedings of higher quality, available more quickly to
the community, and better recognized.  We encourage you to learn from
these papers as well as the corresponding videos of the talks at
