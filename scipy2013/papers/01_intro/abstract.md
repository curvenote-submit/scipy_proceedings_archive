SciPy 2013, the twelfth annual Scientific Computing with Python conference, was held June 24th-29th 2013 in Austin, Texas, USA.

SciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from academic, commercial, andgovernmental organizations to showcase their newest tools and technics, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborateon code development.

These tools most often involve lower level languages but are characterized by a common goal of exposing most functionalities to Python users to maximize efficiency andsimplicity of usage.

This 12th edition has seen an amazing surge in attendance, with people from 5 continents, while retaining the great collaborative and friendly atmosphere that has characterized SciPy conferences over the years. Among many other improvements, this edition has seen a big push in making the proceedings of higher quality, available more quickly to the community, and better recognized.

We encourage you to learn from these papers as well as the corresponding videos of the talks at http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013. If you were able to attend SciPy2013, we hope this conference has been fruitful professionally, allowing you to expand your knowledge and network. And even if you were not able to join us this year, we hope to see you in 2014!

For the SciPy2013 organizers, Andy Terrel and Jonathan Rocher, chairs of SciPy2013
