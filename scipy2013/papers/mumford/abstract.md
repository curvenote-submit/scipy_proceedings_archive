title: "SunPy: Python for Solar Physicists"
description: SunPy is a data analysis toolkit which provides the necessary
  software for analyzing solar and heliospheric datasets in Python. SunPy aims
  to provide a free and open-source alternative to the current standard, an
  IDL-based solar data analysis environment known as SolarSoft (SSW).
abstract: "SunPy is a data analysis toolkit which provides the necessary
  software for analyzing solar and heliospheric datasets in Python. SunPy aims
  to provide a free and open-source alternative to the current standard, an
  IDL-based solar data analysis environment known as SolarSoft (SSW). We present
  the latest release of SunPy, version 0.3. Though still in active development,
  SunPy already provides important functionality for solar data analysis. SunPy
  provides data structures for representing the most common solar data types:
  images, lightcurves, and spectra. To enable the acquisition of scientific
  data, SunPy provides integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), a
  single source for accessing most solar data sets, and integration with the
  Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), a database of transient solar events
  such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections. SunPy utilizes many packages
  from the greater scientific Python community, including NumPy and SciPy for
  core data types and analysis routines, PyFITS for opening image files, in FITS
  format, from major solar missions (e.g., SDO/AIA, SOHO/EIT, SOHO/LASCO, and
  STEREO) into WCS-aware map objects, and pandas for advanced time-series
  analysis tools for data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and Proba2/LYRA,
  as well as support for radio spectra (e.g., e-Callisto). Future releases will
  build upon and integrate with current work in the Astropy project and the rest
  of the scientific python community, to bring greater functionality to SunPy
  users."
