title: CLAIMED, a visual and scalable component library for Trusted AI
description: CLAIMED is a component library for artificial intelligence, machine
  learning, \textquotedbl{}extract, transform, load\textquotedbl{} processes and
  data science. The goal is to enable low-code/no-code rapid prototyping by
  providing ready-made components for various business domains, supporting
  various computer languages, working on various data flow editors and running
  on diverse execution engines.
abstract: CLAIMED is a component library for artificial intelligence, machine
  learning, \textquotedbl{}extract, transform, load\textquotedbl{} processes and
  data science. The goal is to enable low-code/no-code rapid prototyping by
  providing ready-made components for various business domains, supporting
  various computer languages, working on various data flow editors and running
  on diverse execution engines. To demonstrate its utility, we constructed a
  workflow composed exclusively of CLAIMED components. For this purpose, we made
  use of a publicly available Computed Tomography (CT) scans dataset covidata
  and created a deep learning model, which is supposed to classify exams as
  either COVID-19 positive or negative. The pipeline was built with Elyra's
  Pipeline Visual Editor, with support for local, Airflow and Kubeflow
  execution.
