    abstract = "Galaxy (homepage: https://galaxyproject.org, main public server: https://usegalaxy.org) is a web-based scientific analysis platform used by tens of thousands of scientists across the world to analyze large biomedical datasets such as those found in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and imaging. Started in 2005, Galaxy continues to focus on three key challenges of data-driven biomedical science: making analyses accessible to all researchers, ensuring analyses are completely reproducible, and making it simple to communicate analyses so that they can be reused and extended. During the last two years, the Galaxy team and the open-source community around Galaxy have made substantial improvements to Galaxy's core framework, user interface, tools, and training materials. Framework and user interface improvements now enable Galaxy to be used for analyzing tens of thousands of datasets, and >5500 tools are now available from the Galaxy ToolShed. The Galaxy community has led an effort to create numerous high-quality tutorials focused on common types of genomic analyses. The Galaxy developer and user communities continue to grow and be integral to Galaxy's development. The number of Galaxy public servers, developers contributing to the Galaxy framework and its tools, and users of the main Galaxy server have all increased substantially.",

SLURM, initially developed for large Linux clusters at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), is a simple cluster manager that can scale to thousands of processors. SLURM is designed to be flexible and fault-tolerant and can be ported to other clusters of different size and architecture with minimal effort. We are certain that SLURM will benefit both users and system architects by providing them with a simple, robust, and highly scalable parallel job execution environment for their cluster system.",

abstract="Firms are seeking to gain greater understanding of and insights into more and more massive quantities of data collected and stored in disparate public and private databases. To effectively and efficiently deploy project resources to the data science search activity and to consequently build and evaluate innovative artifacts, firms are finding that a Design Science Research (DSR) approach can extend into the Data Science (DS) project domain through an iterative, evaluative project management method for the diagnosing, design, implementation, and evolution of data science artifacts. Importantly, DSR also provides a guided, emergent search paradigm that can be integral to finding hidden insights in massive data where the problem and solution domains are both frequently poorly understood at the outset of the DS inquiry. This article examines a case for using the elaborated action design research (eADR) method to inform the DS project management (PM) approach in situ with a Fortune 100 Global Manufacturer. The innovative DS PM approach resulted in multiple innovative DS solution artifacts built and evaluated by a dozen DS PM teams at the firm over the first two years of the DS PM deployment.",
