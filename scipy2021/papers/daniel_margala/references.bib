abstract = {Dynamic, interpreted languages, like Python, are attractive for domain-experts and scientists experimenting with new ideas. However, the performance of the interpreter is often a barrier when scaling to larger data sets. This paper presents a just-in-time compiler for Python that focuses in scientific and array-oriented computing. Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language. In addition, we share our experience in building a JIT compiler using LLVM[1].},

abstract = {MPI for Python provides bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard for the Python programming language and allows any Python program to exploit multiple processors. This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1 specification and defines an object-oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2 C++bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of general Python objects. Efficiency has been tested in a Beowulf class cluster and satisfying results were obtained. MPI for Python is open source and available for download on the web (http://www.cimec.org.ar/python).}

abstract = {We describe a new effort at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) in performance analysis and optimization of scientific Python applications targeting the Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing, KNL) manycore architecture. The Python-centered work outlined here is part of a larger effort called the NERSC Exascale Science Applications Program (NESAP) for Data. NESAP for Data focuses on applications that process and analyze high-volume, high-velocity data sets from experimental or observational science (EOS) facilities supported by the US Department of Energy Office of Science. We present three case study applications from NESAP for Data that use Python. These codes vary in terms of "Python purity" from applications developed in pure Python to ones that use Python mainly as a convenience layer for scientists without expertise in lower level programming languages like C, C++ or Fortran. The science case, requirements, constraints, algorithms, and initial performance optimizations for each code are discussed. Our goal with this paper is to contribute to the larger conversation around the role of Python in high-performance computing today and tomorrow, highlighting areas for future work and emerging best practices.},
