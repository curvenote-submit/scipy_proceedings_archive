abstract: The signac data management framework (https://signac.io) helps
  researchers execute reproducible computational studies, scales workflows from
  laptops to supercomputers, and emphasizes portability and fast prototyping.
  With signac, users can track, search, and archive data and metadata for
  file-based workflows and automate workflow submission on high performance
  computing (HPC) clusters. We will discuss recent improvements to the
  software's feature set, scalability, scientific applications, usability, and
  community. Newly implemented synced data structures, features for generalized
  workflow execution, and performance optimizations will be covered, as well as
  recent research using the framework and changes to the project's outreach and
  governance as a response to its growth.
