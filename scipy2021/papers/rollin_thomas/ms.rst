Monitoring Scientific Python Usage on a Supercomputer
=====================================================

.. class:: abstract

   In 2021, more than 30% of users at the National Energy Research Scientific
   Computing Center (NERSC) used Python on the Cori supercomputer. To determine
   this we have developed and open-sourced a simple, minimally invasive monitoring
   framework that
   leverages standard Python features to capture Python imports and other job data
   via a package called "Customs". To analyze the data we collect via Customs,
   we have developed a Jupyter-based analysis framework designed to be interactive,
   shareable, extensible, and publishable via a dashboard. Our stack includes
   Papermill to execute parameterized notebooks, Dask-cuDF for multi-GPU
   processing, and Voila to render our notebooks as web-based dashboards. We
   report preliminary findings from Customs data collection and analysis. This
   work demonstrates that our monitoring framework can capture insightful and
   actionable data including top Python libraries, preferred user software
   stacks, and correlated libraries, leading to a better understanding of
   user behavior and affording us opportunity to make increasingly data-driven
   decisions regarding Python at NERSC.

Introduction
============

The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (`NERSC
<https://www.nersc.gov/about/>`_) is the primary scientific computing facility
for the US Department of Energy's Office of Science.
Some 8,000 scientists use NERSC to perform basic, non-classified research in
predicting novel materials, modeling the Earth's climate, understanding the
evolution of the Universe, analyzing experimental particle physics data,
investigating protein structure, and more [OA20]_.
NERSC procures and operates supercomputers and massive storage systems under a
strategy of balanced, timely introduction of new hardware and software
technologies to benefit the broadest possible portion of this workload.
While procuring new systems or supporting users of existing ones, NERSC relies
on detailed analysis of its workload to help inform strategy.

*Workload analysis* is the process of collecting and marshaling data to build a
picture of how applications and users really interact with and utilize systems.
It is one part of a procurement strategy that also includes surveys of user and
application requirements, emerging computer science research, developer or
vendor roadmaps, and technology trends.
Understanding our workload helps us engage in an informed way with stakeholders
like funding agencies, vendors, developers, users, standards bodies, and other
high-performance computing (HPC) centers.
In particular, workload analysis informs non-recurring engineering contracts
where NERSC partners with external software developers to address gaps in system
programming environments.
Actively monitoring the workload also enables us to identify suboptimal or
potentially problematic user practices and address them through direct
intervention, improving documentation, or simply making it easier for users to
use the software better.
Measuring the relative frequency of use of different software components can
help us streamline delivery, retiring less-utilized packages, and promoting
timely migration to newer versions.
Detecting and analyzing trends in user behavior with software over time also
helps us anticipate user needs and prepare accordingly.
Comprehensive, quantitative workload analysis is a critical tool in keeping
NERSC a productive supercomputer center for science.

With Python assuming a key role in scientific computing, it makes sense to apply
workload analysis to Python in production settings like NERSC's Cray XC-40
supercomputer, Cori.
Once viewed in HPC circles as merely a cleaner alternative to Perl or Shell
scripting, Python has evolved into a robust platform for orchestrating
simulations, running complex data processing pipelines, managing artificial
intelligence workflows, visualizing massive data sets, and more.
Adapting workload analysis practices to scientific Python gives its community
the same data-driven leverage that other language communities at NERSC already
enjoy.

This article documents NERSC's Python workload analysis efforts, part of an
initiative called Monitoring of Data Services (MODS) [MODS]_, and
what we have learned during this process.
In the next section, we provide an overview of related work including existing
tools for workload data collection, management, and analysis.
In Methods, we describe an approach to Python-centric workload analysis that
uses built-in Python features to capture usage data, and a Jupyter
notebook-based workflow for exploring the data set and communicating what we discover.
Our Results include high-level statements about what Python packages are used
most often and at what scale on Cori, but also some interesting deeper dives
into use of certain specific packages along with a few surprises.
In the Discussion, we examine the implications of our results, share the strengths
and weaknesses of our workflow and our lessons learned, and outline plans for
improving the analysis to better fill out the picture of Python at NERSC.
The Conclusion suggests some areas for future work.

Related Work
============

The simplest approach used to get a sense of what applications run on a
supercomputer is to scan submitted batch job scripts for executable names.
In the case of Python applications, this is problematic since users often
invoke Python scripts directly instead of as an argument to the ``python``
executable.
This method also provides only a crude count of Python invocations and gives
little insight into deeper questions about specific Python packages.

Software environment modules [Fur91]_ are a common way for HPC centers to
deliver software to users.
Environment modules operate primarily by setting, modifying, or deleting
environment variables upon invocation of a module command (e.g. ``module
load``, ``module swap``, or ``module unload``)
This provides an entrypoint for software usage monitoring.
Staff can inject code into a module load operation to record the name of the
module being loaded, its version, and other information about the user's
environment.
Lmod, a newer implementation of environment modules [Mcl11]_, provides
documentation on how to configure it to use syslog and MySQL to collect module
loads through a
`hook function <https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/300_tracking_module_usage.html>`_.
Counting module loads as a way to track Python usage has the virtue of
simplicity.
However, users often include module load commands in their shell resource files
(e.g., `.bashrc`), meaning that user login or shell invocation may trigger a
detection even if the user never actually uses the trigger module.
Furthermore, capturing information at the package level using module load counts
would also require that individual Python packages be installed as separate
environment modules.
Module load counts also miss Python usage from user-installed Python
environments or in containers.

Tools like ALTD [Fah10]_ and XALT [Agr14]_ are commonly used in HPC contexts to
track library usage in compiled applications.
The approach is to introduce wrappers that intercept the linker and batch job
launcher (e.g. ``srun`` in the case of Slurm used at NERSC).
The linker wrapper can inject metadata into the executable header, take a census
of libraries being linked in, and forward that information to a file or database
for subsequent analysis.
Information stored in the header at link time is dumped and forwarded later by
the job launch wrapper.
On systems where all user applications are linked and launched with instrumented
wrappers, this approach yields a great deal of actionable information to HPC
center staff.
However, popular Python distributions such as Anaconda Python arrive on systems
fully built, and can be installed by users without assistance from center
staff.
Later versions of XALT can address this through an ``LD_PRELOAD`` setting.
This enables XALT to identify compiled extensions that are imported in Python
programs using a non-instrumented Python, but pure Python libraries currently
are not detected.
XALT is an active project so this may be addressed in a future release.

[Mac17]_ describes an approach to monitoring Python package use on Blue Waters
using only built-in Python features: ``sitecustomize`` and ``atexit``.
During normal Python interpreter start-up, an attempt is made to import a module
named ``sitecustomize`` that is intended to perform site-specific
customizations.  In this case, the injected code registers an exit handler
through the ``atexit`` standard library module.
This exit handler inspects ``sys.modules``, a dictionary that normally describes
all packages imported in the course of execution.
On Blue Waters, ``sitecustomize`` was installed into the Python distribution
installed and maintained by staff.
Collected information was stored to plain text log files.
An advantage of this approach is that ``sitecustomize`` failures are nonfatal,
and placing the import reporting step into an exit hook (as opposed to
instrumenting the import mechanism) means that it minimizes interference with
normal operation of the host application.
The major limitation of this strategy is that abnormal process terminations
prevent the Python interpreter from proceeding through its normal exit sequence
and package import data are not recorded.

Of course, much more information may be available through tools based on the
extended
`Berkeley Packet Filter <https://ebpf.io/>`_
and the
`BPF compiler collection <https://github.com/iovisor/bcc>`_,
similar to the ``pythoncalls`` utility that summarizes method calls in a
running application.
While eBPF overheads are very small, this approach requires special
compilation flags for Python and libraries.
Effort would be needed to make the monitoring more transparent to users and to
marshal the generated data for subsequent analysis.
This could be an interesting and fruitful approach to consider.
Obviously, solutions that can overly impact application reliability or place an
undue burden on system administrators and operations staff should be avoided.
The fullest picture we currently can obtain comes from a combination of
non-intrusive tooling and follow-up with users, using the story we can put
together from the data we gather as a starting point for conversation.

Methods
=======

Users have a number of options when it comes to how they use Python at NERSC.
NERSC provides a "default" Python to its users through a software environment
module, based on the Anaconda Python distribution with modifications.
Users may load this module, initialize the Conda tool, and create their own
custom Conda environments.
Projects or collaborations may provide their users with shared Python
environments, often as a Conda environment or as an independent installation
altogether (e.g. using the Miniconda installer and building up).
Cray provides a basic "Cray Python" module containing a few core scientific
Python packages linked against Cray MPICH and LibSci libraries.
Python packages are also installed by staff or users via Spack [Gam15]_, an HPC
package manager.
NERSC also provides Shifter [Jac16]_, a container runtime that enables users to
run custom Docker containers that can contain Python built however the author
desires.
With a properly defined kernel-spec file, a user is able to use a Python
environment based on any of the above options as a kernel in NERSC's Jupyter
service.
The goal is to gather data for workload analysis across all of these options.

   NERSC infrastructure for capturing Python usage data.
   :label:`save-data`

Monitoring all of the above can be done quite easily by using the strategy
outlined in [Mac17]_ with certain changes.
Fig. :ref:`save-data` illustrates the infrastructure we have configured.
As in [Mac17]_ a ``sitecustomize`` that registers the ``atexit`` handler is
installed in a directory included into all users' Python ``sys.path``.
The ``sitecustomize`` module is installed directly on each compute node
and not served over network, in order to avoid exacerbating poor performance of
Python start-up at scale.
We accomplish this by installing it and any associated Python modules into the
node system images themselves, and configuring default user environments to
include a ``PYTHONPATH`` setting that injects ``sitecustomize`` into
``sys.path``.
Shifter containers include the monitoring packages from the system image via
runtime volume mount.
Users can opt out of monitoring simply by unsetting or overwriting
``PYTHONPATH``.
We took the approach of provisioning a system-wide ``PYTHONPATH`` because we
cast a much wider collection net (opt-out) than if we depend on users to install
``sitecustomize`` (opt-in).
This also gives us a centrally managed source of truth for what is monitored at
any given time.

Customs: Inspect and Report Packages
------------------------------------

To organize ``sitecustomize`` logic we have created a Python package we call
`Customs <https://github.com/NERSC/customs>`_,
since it is for inspecting and reporting on Python package imports of
particular interest.
Customs can be understood in terms of three simple concepts.
A **Check** is a simple object that represents a Python package by its name and
a callable that is used to verify that the package (or even a specific module
within a package) is present in a given dictionary.
In production this dictionary should be ``sys.modules`` but during testing it
can be a mock ``sys.modules`` dictionary.
The **Inspector** is a container of Check objects, and is responsible for
applying each Check to ``sys.modules`` (or mock) and returning the names of
packages that are detected.
Finally, the **Reporter** is an abstract class that takes some action given a
list of detected package names.
The Reporter action should be to record or transmit the list of detected
packages, but exactly how this is done depends on implementation.
Customs includes a few reference Reporter implementations and an example of a
custom Customs Reporter.

Customs provides an entry point to use in ``sitecustomize``, the function
``register_exit_hook``.
This function takes two arguments.
The first is a list of strings or (string, callable) tuples that are converted
into Checks.
The second argument is the type of Reporter to be used.
The exit hook can be registered multiple times with different package
specification lists or Reporters if desired.

The intended workflow is that a staff member creates a list of package
specifications they want to check for, selects or implements an appropriate
Reporter, and passes these two objects to ``register_exit_hook`` within
``sitecustomize.py``.
Installing ``sitecustomize`` to system images generally involves packaging the
software as an RPM to be installed into node system images and deployed by
system administrators.
When a user invokes Python, the exit hook will be registered using the
``atexit`` standard library module, the application proceeds as normal, and then
at normal shutdown ``sys.modules`` is inspected and detected packages of
interest are reported.

Message Logging and Storage
---------------------------

NERSC has developed a lightweight abstraction layer for message logging called
nerscjson.
It is a simple Python package that consumes JSON messages and forwards them to
an appropriate transport layer that connects to NERSC's Operations Monitoring
and Notification Infrastructure (OMNI) [Bau19]_.
Currently this is done with Python's standard ``SysLogHandler`` from the
logging library, modified to format time to satisfy RFC 3339.
Downstream from these transport layers, a message key is used to identify the
incoming messages, their JSON payloads are extracted, and then forwarded to the
appropriate `Elasticsearch <https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/7.10.0/>`_
index. The Customs Reporter used on Cori simply uses nerscjson.

On Cori compute nodes, we use the Cray Lightweight Log Manager (LLM),
configured to accept RFC 5424 protocol messages on service nodes.
A random service node is chosen as the recipient in order to balance load.
On other nodes besides compute nodes, such as login nodes or nodes running
user-facing services, rsyslog is used for message transport.
This abstraction layer allows us to maintain a stable interface for logging
while using an appropriately scalable transport layer for the system.
For instance, future systems will rely on Apache Kafka or the Lightweight
Distributed Metrics Service [Age14]_.

Cori has 10,000 compute nodes running jobs at very high utilization, 24 hours a
day for more than 340 days in a typical year.
The volume of messages arriving from Python processes completing could be quite
high, so we have taken a cautious approach of monitoring a list of about 50
Python packages instead of reporting the entire contents of each process's
``sys.modules``.
This introduces a potential source of bias that we return to in the Discussion,
but we note here that Python 3.10 will include ``sys.stdlib_module_names``, a
frozenset of strings containing the names of standard library modules, that
could be used in addition to ``sys.builtin_module_names`` to remove standard
library and built-in modules from ``sys.modules`` easily.
Ultimately we plan to capture all imports excluding standard and built-in
packages, except for ones we consider particularly relevant to scientific
Python workflows like ``multiprocessing``.

To reduce excessive duplication of messages from MPI-parallel Python
applications, we prevent reporting from processes with nonzero MPI rank or
``SLURM_PROCID``.
Other parallel applications using e.g. ``multiprocessing`` are harder to
deduplicate.
This moves deduplication downstream to the analysis phase.
The key is to carry along enough additional information to enable the kinds of
deduplication needed (e.g., by user, by job, by node, etc).
Table :ref:`metadata` contains a partial list of metadata captured and forwarded
along with package names and versions.

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

Fields that only make sense in a batch job context are set to a default
(``num_nodes: 1``) or left empty (``repo: ""``).
Basic job quantities like node count help capture the most salient features of
jobs being monitored.
Downstream joins with other OMNI indexes or other databases containing Slurm
job data (via ``job_id``), identity (``username``), or banking (``repo``)
enables broader insights.

In principle it is possible that messages may be dropped along the way to OMNI,
since we are using UDP for transport.
To control for this source of error, we submit scheduled "canary jobs" a few
dozen times a day that run a Python script that imports libraries listed in
``sitecustomize`` and then exits normally.
Matching up those job submissions with entries in Elastic enables us to quantify
the message failure rate.
Canary jobs began running in October of 2020 and from that time until now (May
2021), perhaps surprisingly, we actually have observed no message delivery
failures.

Prototyping, Production, and Publication
----------------------------------------

OMNI has a Kibana visualization interface that NERSC staff use to visualize
Elasticsearch-indexed data collected from NERSC systems, including data
collected for MODS.
The MODS team uses Kibana for creating plots of usage data, organizing these
into attractive dashboard displays that communicate MODS high-level metrics.
Kibana is very effective at providing a general picture of user behavior with
the NERSC data stack, but the MODS team wanted deeper insights from the data and
obtaining these through Kibana presented some difficulty, especially
due to the complexities of deduplication we discussed in the previous section.
Given that the MODS team is fluent in Python, and that NERSC provides users
(including staff) with a productive Python ecosystem for data analytics, using
Python tools for understanding the data was a natural choice.
Using the same environment and tools that users have access to provides us a way
to test how well those tools actually work.

Our first requirement was the ability to explore MODS Python data interactively.
However, we also wanted to be able to record that
process, document it, share it, and enable others to re-run or re-create the
results.
Jupyter Notebooks specifically target this problem, and NERSC already runs a
user-facing JupyterHub service that enables access to Cori.
Members of the MODS team can manage notebooks in a Gitlab instance run by NERSC,
or share them with one another (and from Gitlab) using an NBViewer service
running alongside NERSC's JupyterHub.

Iterative prototyping of data analysis pipelines often starts with testing
hypotheses or algorithms against a small subset of the data and then scaling
that analysis up to the entire data set.
GPU-based tools with Python interfaces for filtering, analyzing, and distilling
data can accelerate this scale-up using generally fewer compute nodes than
with CPU-based tools.
The entire MODS Python data set is currently about 260 GB in size, and while
this could fit into one of Cori's CPU-based large-memory nodes, the processing
power available there is insufficient to make interactive analysis feasible.
With only CPUs, the main recourse is to scale out to more nodes and distribute
the data.
This is certainly possible, but being able to interact with the entire data set
using a few GPUs, far fewer processes, and without inter-node communication is
compelling.

To do interactive analysis, prototyping, or data exploration we use
`Dask-cudf <https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/dask-cudf.html>`_
and cuDF, typically using 4 NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs coordinated by a
`Dask-CUDA <https://dask-cuda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ cluster.
The Jupyter notebook itself is started from NERSC's JupyterHub using
BatchSpawner (i.e., the Hub submits a batch job to run the notebook on the GPU
cluster).
The input data, in compressed Parquet format, are read using Dask-cuDF directly
into GPU memory.
These data are periodically gathered from OMNI using the
Python Elasticsearch API and converted to Parquet.
Reduced data products are stored in new Parquet files, again using direct GPU
I/O.

As prototype analysis code in notebooks evolves into something resembling a
production analysis pipeline, data scientists face the choice of whether to
convert their notebooks into scripts or try to stretch their notebook to serve
as a production tool.
The latter approach has the appeal that production notebooks can be re-run
interactively when needed with all the familiar Jupyter notebook benefits.
We decided to experiment with using
`Papermill <https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
to parameterize notebook
execution over months, quarters, and years of data and submit these notebooks as
batch jobs.
In each Jupyter notebook, a Dask-CUDA cluster is spun up and then shutdown at
the end for memory/worker cleanup.
Processing all data for all permutations currently takes about 2 hours on 4
V100 GPUs on the Cori GPU cluster.
Fig. :ref:`analyze-data` illustrates the workflow.

.. figure:: mods-analyze-data.png
   :scale: 9%

   Workflow for processing and analyzing Python usage data.
   :label:`analyze-data`

Members of the MODS team can share Jupyter notebooks with one another, but this
format may not make for the best way to present data to other stakeholders, in
particular center management, DOE program managers, vendors, or users.
`Voilà <https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ is a tool
that uses a Jupyter notebook to power a stand-alone, interactive dashboard-style
web application.
We decided to experiment with Voilà for this project to evaluate best practices
for its use at NERSC.
To run our dashboards we use NERSC's Docker container-as-a-service platform,
called 
`Spin <https://www.nersc.gov/systems/spin/>`_,
where staff and users can run persistent web services.
Spin is external to NERSC's HPC resources and has no nodes with GPUs, but mounts
the NERSC Global Filesystem.

Creating a notebook using a GPU cluster and then using the same notebook to
power a dashboard running on a system without GPUs presents a few challenges.
We found ourselves adopting a pattern where the first part of the notebook used
a Dask cluster and GPU-enabled tools for processing the data, and the second
part of the notebook used reduced data using CPUs to power the dashboard
visualizations.
We used cell metadata tags to direct Voilà to simply skip the first set of cells
and pick up dashboard rendering with the reduced data.
This process was a little clumsy, and we found it easy to make the mistake of
adding a cell and then forgetting to update its metadata.
Easier ways of managing cell metadata tags would improve this process.
Another side-effect of this approach is that packages may appear to be imported
multiple times in a notebook.

We found that even reduced data sets could be large enough to make loading a
Voilà dashboard slow, but we found ways to hide this by lazily loading the data.
Using Pandas DataFrames to prepare even reduced data sets for rendering,
especially histograms, resulted in substantial latency when interacting with the
dashboard.
Vaex [vaex]_ provided for a more responsive user experience, owing to
multi-threaded CPU parallelism.
We did use some of Vaex's native plotting functionality (in particular
``viz.histogram``), but we primarily used Seaborn for plotting with Vaex objects
"underneath" which we found to be a fast and friendly way to generate appealing
visualizations.
Sometimes Matplotlib was used when Seaborn could not meet our needs (to
create a stacked barplot, for example).

Finally, we note that the Python environment used for both data exploration and
reduction on the GPU cluster, and for running the Voilà dashboard in Spin, is
managed using a single Docker image (Shifter runtime on GPU, Kubernetes in Spin).

Results
=======

Our data collection framework yields a rich data set to examine and
our workflow enables us to interactively explore the data and translate the
results of our exploration into dashboards for monitoring Python.
Results presented come from data collected between January and May 2021.
Unless otherwise noted, all results exclude Python usage by members of NERSC
staff (``is_staff==False``) and include only results collected from batch jobs
(``is_compute==True``).
All figures are extracted from the Jupyter notebook/Voilà dashboard.

During the period of observation there were 2448 users running jobs
that used Python on Cori, equivalent to just over 30% of all NERSC users.
84% of jobs using Python ran on Cori's Haswell-based partition, 14% used
Cori-KNL, and 2% used Cori's GPU cluster.
63% of Python users use the NERSC-provided Python module directly (including on
login nodes and Jupyter nodes) but only 5% of jobs using Python use the module:
Most use a user-built Python environment, namely Conda environments.
Anaconda Python provides scientific Python libraries linked against the Intel
Math Kernel Library (MKL), but we observe that only about 17% of MKL-eligible
jobs (ones using NumPy, SciPy, NumExpr, or scikit-learn) are using MKL.
We consider this finding in more detail in Discussion.

.. figure:: library-barplot-2021.png

   Top 20 tracked Python libraries at NERSC, deduplicated by user,
   across our system.
   :label:`lib-barplot`

Fig. :ref:`lib-barplot` displays the top 20 Python packages in use determined
from unique user imports (i.e. how many users ever use a given package) across
the system, including login nodes and Jupyter nodes.
These top libraries are similar to previous observations reported from Blue
Waters and TACC [Mcl11]_ [Eva15]_, but the relative prominence of
``multiprocessing`` is striking.
We also note that Joblib, a package for lightweight pipelining and easy
parallelism, ranks higher than both mpi4py and Dask.

The relatively low rankings for TensorFlow and PyTorch are probably due to the
current lack of GPU resources, as Cori provides access to only 18 GPU nodes
mainly for application readiness activities in support of Perlmutter, the next
(GPU-based) system being deployed.
Additionally, some users that are training deep learning models submit a chain
of jobs that may not be expected to finish within the requested walltime; the
result is that the job may end before Customs can capture data from the
``atexit``, resulting in under-reporting.

Most of these jobs are small, but the distribution tracks the overall
distribution of job size at NERSC.

   2D histogram of Python package counts versus job size. The
   marginal x-axis (right) shows the total package counts. The marginal
   y-axis (top) shows the total job counts displayed on a log scale.
   Here we measure number of unique packages used within a job rather
   than number of jobs, so these data are not directly comparable
   to Fig. :ref:`lib-barplot` nor to Fig. :ref:`jobsize-hist`.
   :label:`jobsize-lib`

Breaking down the Python workload further, Fig. :ref:`jobsize-lib` contains a 2D
histogram of Python package counts as a function of job size.
Package popularity in this figure has a different meaning than in Fig.
:ref:`lib-barplot`:
The data are deduplicated by ``job_id`` and package name to account for jobs
where users invoke the same executable repeatedly or invoke multiple
applications using the same libraries. The marginal axes summarize the
total package counts and total job size counts as a function of
``job_id``.
Most Python libraries we track do not appear to use more than 200 nodes.
Perhaps predictably, ``mpi4py`` and NumPy are observed at the largest node
counts.
Dask jobs are observed at 500 nodes and fewer, so it appears that Dask is not
being used to scale as large as ``mpi4py`` is.
Workflow managers FireWorks [Jai15]_ and Parsl [Bab19]_ are observed scaling to
1000 nodes.
PyTorch (``torch``) appears at larger scales than TensorFlow and Keras, which
suggests users may find it easier to scale PyTorch on Cori.

.. figure:: corr-clip-2021.png

   Pearson correlation coefficients for tracked Python libraries within the same
   job.
   Libraries were only counted once per job. Here we display correlation
   coefficient values between 0.6 and 0.8 in an effort to highlight
   a regime in which packages have a strong relationship but no explicit
   dependencies. :label:`corr2d`

While it is obvious that packages that depend on or are dependencies of other
packages will be correlated within jobs, it is still interesting to examine the
co-occurrence of certain packages within jobs.
A simple way of looking at this is to determine Pearson correlation coefficients
for each tracked library with all others, assigning a 1 to jobs in which a
certain package was used and 0 otherwise.
Fig. :ref:`corr2d` shows an example package correlation heatmap.
The heatmap includes only package correlations above 0.6 to omit less
interesting relationships and less than 0.8 as a simple way to filter out
interdependencies.
Notable relationships between non-dependent packages include ``mpi4py`` and
AstroPy, Seaborn and TensorFlow, FireWorks and Plotly.

We used this correlation information as a starting point for examining package
use alongside ``mpi4py``, ``multiprocessing``, and Dask, all of which we are
especially interested in because they enable parallelism within batch jobs.
We omit Joblib, noting that a number of packages depend on Joblib and Joblib
itself uses ``multiprocessing``.
Fig. :ref:`case-studies` presents the correlations of each of these packages
with all other tracked packages.

.. figure:: case-studies-2021.png
   :scale: 33%

   Pearson correlation coefficient values for
   ``mpi4py`` (left), ``multiprocessing`` (center), and Dask (right),
   with all other Python libraries we currently track.
   :label:`case-studies`

The strongest correlations observed for ``mpi4py`` (Fig. :ref:`case-studies`,
left) is the domain-specific package AstroPy and its submodule
``astropy.io.fits``.
This suggests that users of AstroPy have been able to scale associated
applications using ``mpi4py`` and that AstroPy developers may want to consider
engaging with ``mpi4py`` users regarding their experiences.
Following up with users generally reveals that using ``mpi4py`` for
"embarrassingly parallel" calculations is very common: "My go-to approach is to
broadcast data using ``mpi4py``, split up input hyperparameters/settings/etc.
across ranks, have each rank perform some number of computations, and then
gather all the results (which are almost always NumPy arrays) using ``mpi4py``."
Very few users report more intricate communication patterns.

Next we consider ``multiprocessing``.
The ``conda`` tool uses ``multiprocessing`` but even after filtering out those
cases, it remains one of the most popular Python libraries in use on Cori.
In Fig. :ref:`case-studies` (center), we do not see any particularly strong
relationships as we did with ``mpi4py``.
The primary correlation visible here is with SciPy, which has some built-in
support for inter-operating with ``multiprocessing``, for instance through
``scipy.optimize``.
To learn more we followed up with several of the top ``multiprocessing`` users.
One reported: "I'm using and testing many bioinformatics Python-based packages,
some of them probably using Python ``multiprocessing``.
But I'm not specifically writing myself scripts with ``multiprocessing``."
Another reported: "The calculations are executing a workflow for computing the
binding energies of ligands in metal complexes.
Since each job is independent, ``multiprocessing`` is used to start workflows on
each available processor."
As a package that users directly interact with, and as a dependency of other
packages in scientific Python, ``multiprocessing`` is a workhorse.

Finally we consider Dask, a Python package for task-based parallelism and
analytics at scale.
Users are increasingly interested in cluster runtimes where they queue up work,
submit the work to the scheduler as a task graph, and the scheduler handles
dependencies and farms out the tasks to workers.
Dask also inter-operates with GPU analytics libraries from NVIDIA as part of
RAPIDS, so we are naturally interested in its potential for our next system
based in part on GPUs.
As noted, large jobs using Dask are generally smaller than those using
``mpi4py`` (500 nodes versus 3000+ nodes), which may indicate a potential gap in
scalability on Cori.
The correlation data shown in Fig. :ref:`case-studies` (right) indicate an
affinity with the weather and climate community, where ``netCDF4`` and
``xarray`` seem particularly important.
We reached out to several Dask users to learn more.
One responded: "I don't remember having any Python Dask-related jobs running in
the past 3 months."
After some additional discussion and analysis, we discovered the user was using
``xarray`` which we believe was using Dask unbeknownst to the user.
This kind of response from "Dask users" was not uncommon.

Discussion
==========

Our results demonstrate that we are able to collect useful data on Python
package use on Cori, tag it with additional metadata useful for filtering during
analysis, and conduct exploratory analysis of the data that can easily evolve to
production and publication.
The results themselves confirm many of our expectations about Python use on
Cori, but also reveal some surprises that suggest next actions for various
stakeholders.
Such surprises suggest new opportunities for engagements between NERSC, users,
vendors, and developers of scientific Python infrastructure.

We observe that Python jobs on Cori mostly come from environments that users
themselves have provisioned, and not directly from the Python software
environment module that NERSC provides.
Our expectation was that the fraction of jobs running from such environments
would be high since we knew through interacting with our users that
custom Conda environments were very popular.
A major driver behind this popularity is that users often want versions of
packages that are newer than they what can get from a centrally-managed Python
environment.
But rather than take that as a cue that we should be updating the NERSC-provided
Python environment more often, finding new ways to empower users to manage
their own software better has become our priority instead.
This currently includes continuing to provide easy access to Conda
environments, locations for centralized installations (i.e. shared by a
collaboration), and improved support for containerized environments. However
we are constantly reevaluating how best to support the needs of our users.

Other results indicate that this may need to be done carefully.
As mentioned in the Results, only about 17% of jobs that use NumPy, SciPy,
scikit-learn, or NumExpr are using versions of those packages that rely on
OpenMP-threaded, optimized Intel MKL.
Given that Cori's CPU architectures come from Intel, we might expect the best
performance to come from libraries optimized for that architecture.
We caution that there are a number of hypotheses to consider behind this
observation, as it is a question of how well-educated users are on the potential
benefits of such libraries.
The surprising reliance of our users on ``multiprocessing`` and the tendency of
users to use ``mpi4py`` for embarrassing parallelism suggest that users may find
it easier to manage process parallelism than OpenMP thread parallelism in
scientific Python.
Another consideration is that users value ease in software installation rather
than performance.
Many Conda users rely heavily on the ``conda-forge`` channel, which does have a
much greater diversity of packages as compared to the ``defaults`` channel, and
will install libraries based on OpenBLAS.
Users may be willing or able to tolerate some performance loss in favor of being
able to easily install and update their software stack.
(There
are no easy answers or quick fixes to this problem of facilitating both
easy installation and good performance, but this is a major
goal of our efforts to support Python at NERSC.)
Finally, many users install complex packages designed for use on a wide range of
systems; many of these packages such as
`GPAW <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/install.html>`_
may use OpenBLAS rather than MKL.
Having seen that MKL adoption is low, our goal is to try to
better understand the factors leading to this and ensure that users who can
benefit from MKL make good choices about how they build their Python
environments through documentation, training, and direct recommendation.

While some discoveries suggest next actions and user engagement for NERSC staff,
others suggest opportunities for broader stakeholder action.
The importance of ``multiprocessing`` to users on nodes with large core count
suggests an opportunity for developers and system vendors.
Returning to the observation that jobs using AstroPy have an tendency to also
use ``mpi4py``, we conclude that users of AstroPy have been able to scale their
AstroPy-based applications using MPI and that AstroPy developers may want to
consider engaging with our users to make that interaction better.
Examining the jobs further we find that these users tend to be members of large
cosmology experiments like Dark Energy Survey [Abb18]_, Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument [DESI]_, the Dark Energy Science Collaboration
[DESC]_, and CMB-S4 [Aba16]_.
The pattern appears over many users in several experiments.
We also note that the use of ``astropy.io.fits`` in MPI-enabled Python jobs by
astronomers suggests that issues related to FITS I/O performance in AstroPy on
HPC systems may be another area of focus.

While the results are interesting, making support decisions based on data alone
has its pitfalls.
There are limitations to the data set, its analysis, and statements we can make
based on the data, some of which can be addressed easily and others not.
First and foremost, we address the limitation that we are tracking a prescribed
list of packages, an obvious source of potential bias.
The reason for prescribing a list is technical: Large bursts of messages from
jobs running on Cori at one time caused issues for OMNI infrastructure and we
were asked to find ways to limit the rate of messages or prevent such kinds of
bursts.
Since then, OMNI has evolved and may be able to handle a higher data rate,
making it possible to simply report all entries in ``sys.modules`` excluding
built-in and standard modules (but not entirely, as ``multiprocessing`` would go
undetected).
One strategy may be to forward ``sys.modules`` to OMNI on a very small random
subset of jobs (say 1%) and use that control data set to estimate bias in the
tracked list.
It also helps us control for a major concern, that of missing out on data on
emerging new packages.

Another source of bias is user opt-out.
Sets of users who opt out tend to do so in groups, in particular collaborations
or experiments who manage their own software stacks: Opting out is not a random
error source, it is another source of systematic error.
A common practice is for such collaborations to provide scripts that help a user
"activate" their environment and may unset or rewrite ``PYTHONPATH``.
This can cause undercounts in key packages, but we have very little enthusiasm
for removing the opt-out capability.
Rather, we believe we should make a positive case for users to remain opted in,
based on the benefits it delivers to them.
Indeed, that is a major motivation for this paper.

A different systematic undercount may occur for applications that habitually run
into their allocated batch job wallclock limit.
As mentioned with TensorFlow, we confirmed with users a particular pattern of
submitting chains of dozens of training jobs that each pick up where the
previous job left off.
If all these jobs hit the wallclock limit, we will not collect any data.
Counting the importance of a package by the number of jobs that use it is
dubious; we favor understanding the impact of a package from the breadth of the
user community that uses it.
This further supports the idea that multiple approaches to understanding Python
package use are needed to build a complete picture; each has its own
shortcomings that may be complemented by others.

Part of the power of scientific Python is that it enables its developers to
build upon the work of others, so when a user imports a package it may import
several other dependencies.
All of these libraries "matter" in some sense, but we find that often users are
importing those packages without even being aware they are being used.
For instance, when we contacted users who appeared to be running Dask jobs at a
node count of 100 or greater, we received several responses like
"I'm a bit curious as to why I got this email.
I'm not aware to have used Dask in the past, but perhaps I did it without
realizing it."
More generally, large-scale jobs may use Python only incidentally for
housekeeping operations.
Importing a package is not the same as actual use, and use of a package in a job
running at scale is not the same as that package actually being used at scale.

Turning to what we learned from the process of building our data analysis
pipeline, we found that the framework gave us ways to follow up on initial clues
and then further productionize the resulting exploratory analysis.
Putting all the steps in the analysis (extraction, aggregation, indexing,
selecting, plotting) into one narrative improves communication, reasoning,
iteration, and reproducibility.
One of our objectives was to manage as much of the data analysis as we could
using one notebook for exploratory analysis with Jupyter, parameterized
calculations in production with Papermill, and shared visualization as
a Voilà dashboard.
Using cell metadata helped us to manage both the computationally-intensive
"upstream" part of the notebook and the less expensive "downstream" dashboard
within a single file.
One disadvantage of this approach is that it is very easy to remove or forget to
apply cell tags.
This could be addressed by making cell metadata easier to apply and manage.
The Voilà JupyterLab extension helps with this problem by providing a preview of
a dashboard rendering before it is published to the web.
Another issue with the single-notebook pattern is that some code may be repeated
for different purposes.
This is not a source of error necessarily, but it can cause confusion.
All of these issues disappear if the same hardware could be used to run the
notebook in exploratory analysis, pipelined production, and dashboard phases,
but these functions are simply not available in a single system at NERSC today.

Conclusion
==========

We have taken our first small steps in understanding the Python workload at
NERSC in detail.
Instrumenting Python to record how frequently key scientific Python packages are
being imported in batch jobs on Cori confirmed many of our assumptions but
yielded a few surprises.
The next step is acting on the information we have gathered, and of course,
monitoring the impact those actions have.

Using Python itself as a platform for analyzing the Python workload poses a few
challenges mostly related to supporting infrastructure and tooling.
With a few tricks, we find that the same Jupyter notebooks can be used for both
exploratory and production data analysis, and also to communicate high-level
results through dashboards.
We initiated this project not only to perform Python workload analysis but to
test the supposition that users could assemble all the pieces they needed for a
Python-based data science pipeline at NERSC.
Along the way, we identified shortcomings in our ecosystem, and this motivated
us to develop tools for users that fill those gaps, and gave us direct
experience with the very same tools our users use to do real science.

In the near future, we will expand Python workload analysis to Perlmutter, a new
system with CPU+GPU and CPU-only nodes to identify users of the CPU nodes who
might be able to take advantage of GPUs.
Other future plans include examining Python use within the context of specific
science areas by linking our data with user account and allocation data, and
using natural language processing and machine learning to proactively identify
issues that users have with Python on our systems.
Another interesting avenue to pursue is whether the monitoring data we gather
may be of use to users as an aid for reproducible computational science.
If users are able to access Python usage data we collect from their jobs, they
could use it to verify what Python packages and package versions were used and
obtain some degree of software provenance for reproducing and verifying their
results.

..
   Future plans include expanding Python workload analysis to the new GPU-based
   Perlmutter system being deployed now at NERSC.
   Through comprehensive monitoring of Python use on Perlmutter we hope to identify
   users of Perlmutter's CPU-only nodes who might be able to migrate to GPUs and
   accelerate their science.
   We look forward to finding out what fraction of our users might be able to do
   this and what the challenges are.
   At the center level, OMNI includes time series data from a variety of sources
   including the HPC and storage systems at NERSC, supporting computational
   infrastructure, environmental sensors, mechanical systems, and more.
   Understanding whether Python use has any measurable impacts at the systems
   level is one potential area of future work.
   Similarly, examining Python use within the context of specific science areas is
   possible by linking usage with user account and allocation data from other
   sources.
   Applying more advanced natural language analysis and machine learning techniques
   to proactively identify issues that users have
   with Python on our systems is also an interesting avenue to pursue.

We anticipate that developers of scientific Python software may find the
information we gather to be informative.

   comment
   **FIXME Does it help to keep this in Methods**
   Finally, to understand the collected data, we use a PyData-centered workflow
   that enables exploration, interactivity, prototyping, and report generation:
   
   * **Jupyter Notebooks,** to interactively explore the data, iteratively
     prototype data analysis and visualizations, and arrange the information for
     reporting, all within a single document.
   * **cuDF** to accelerate tabular data analytics and I/O on a single GPU.
   * **Dask-cuDF and Dask-CUDA** to scale data transformations and analytics
     to multiple GPUs, including I/O.
   * **Papermill,** to automate extraction and transformation of the data as well as
     production runs of Notebooks in multiple-GPU batch jobs on Cori.
   * **Vaex,**, to enable a more responsive dashboard via fast data loading and
     plotting operations.
   * **Voila** to create responsive, interactive dashboards
     for both internal use
     by NERSC staff and management, but also to external stakeholders.
