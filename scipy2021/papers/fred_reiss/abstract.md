  Most areas of Python data science have standardized on using Pandas DataFrames
  for representing and manipulating structured data in memory. Natural Language
  Processing (NLP), not so much.


  We believe that Pandas has the potential to serve as a universal data
  structure for NLP data. DataFrames could make every phase of NLP easier, from
  creating new models, to evaluating their effectiveness, to building
  applications that integrate those models. However, Pandas currently lacks
  important data types and operations for representing and manipulating crucial
  types of data in many of these NLP tasks.


  This paper describes Text Extensions for Pandas, a library of extensions to
  Pandas that make it possible to build end-to-end NLP applications while
  representing all of the applications' internal data with DataFrames. We
  leverage the extension points built into Pandas library to add new data types,
  and we provide important NLP-specfific operations over these data types and
  and integrations with popular NLP libraries and data formats.
