title: CNN Based ToF Image Processing
description: In this paper a Time of Flight (ToF) camera specific data
  processing pipeline is presented, followed by real life applications using
  artificial intelligence. These applications include use cases such as gesture
  recognition, movement direction estimation or physical exercises monitoring.
abstract: In this paper a Time of Flight (ToF) camera specific data processing
  pipeline is presented, followed by real life applications using artificial
  intelligence. These applications include use cases such as gesture
  recognition, movement direction estimation or physical exercises monitoring.
  The whole pipeline for the body pose estimation is described in details,
  starting from generating and training phases to the pose estimation and
  deployment. The final deployment targets were Nvidia Xavier NX and AGX
  platforms receiving data from an Analog Devices ToF camera.
