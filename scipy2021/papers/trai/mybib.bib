@article{Gezawa2020,
abstract = {Deep learning approach has been used extensively in image analysis tasks. However, implementing the methods in 3D data is a bit complex because most of the previously designed deep learning architectures used 1D or 2D as input. In this work, the performance of deep learning methods on different 3D data representations has been reviewed. Based on the categorization of the different 3D data representations proposed in this paper, the importance of choosing a suitable 3D data representation which depends on simplicity, usability, and efficiency has been highlighted. Furthermore, the origin and contents of the major 3D datasets were discussed in detail. Due to growing interest in 3D object retrieval and classification tasks, the performance of different 3D object retrieval and classification on ModelNet40 dataset were compared. According to the findings in this work, multi views methods surpass voxel-based methods and with increased layers and enough data augmentation the performance can still be increased. Therefore, it can be concluded that deep learning together with a suitable 3D data representation gives an effective approach for improving the performance of 3D shape analysis. Finally, some possible directions for future researches were suggested.},
