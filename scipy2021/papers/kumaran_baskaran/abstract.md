abstract: The Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BioMagResBank or BMRB
  https://bmrb.io), founded in 1988, is the international, open archive for data
  generated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of biological
  systems. NMR spectroscopy is unique among biophysical approaches in its
  ability to provide a broad range of atomic and higher-level information
  relevant to the structural, dynamic, and chemical properties of biological
  macromolecules, as well as report on metabolite and natural product
  concentrations in complex mixtures and their chemical structures. NMR-STAR is
  the official data format of BMRB and BMRB provides python parser (PyNMRSTAR
  https://github.com/uwbmrb/PyNMRSTAR), a data visualization tool (PyBMRB
  https://github.com/uwbmrb/PyBMRB) and an Application Program Interface
  (API)(BMRB-API https://github.com/uwbmrb/BMRB-API) to access the BMRB archive.
  PyBMRB displays the chemical shifts data in each entry as a simulated NMR
  spectrum and to generates database-wide chemical shift histograms of different
  atom types in proteins and nucleic acids. PyBMRB provides access to BMRB data
  through the API and generates portable and interactive visualizations as a
  single html file. It also supports data visualization workflows using Jupyter
  Notebooks, which can be both easily created and shared.
