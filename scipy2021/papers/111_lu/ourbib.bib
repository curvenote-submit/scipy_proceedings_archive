	abstract = {The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 has made an impact on the operation of health-care organizations. HIPAA includes 5 titles, and its regulations are complex. Many are familiar with the HIPAA aspects that address protection of the privacy and security of patients{\textquoteright} medical records. There are new rules to HIPAA that address the implementation of electronic medical records. HIPAA provides rules for protected health information (PHI) and what should be protected and secured. The privacy rule regulates the use and disclosure of PHI and sets standards that an entity working with health data must follow to protect patients{\textquoteright} private medical information. The HIPAA security rule complements the privacy rule and requires entities to implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the privacy of PHI. This article{\textemdash}part 1 of a 2-part series{\textemdash}is a refresher on HIPAA, its history, its rules, its implications, and the role that imaging professionals play.},
