title: How PDFrw and fillable forms improves throughput at a Covid-19 Vaccine Clinic
description: PDFrw was used to prepopulate Covid-19 vaccination forms to improve
  the efficiency and integrity of the vaccination process in terms of federal
  and state privacy requirements. We will describe the vaccination process from
  the initial appointment, through the vaccination delivery, to the creation of
  subsequent required documentation.
abstract: PDFrw was used to prepopulate Covid-19 vaccination forms to improve
  the efficiency and integrity of the vaccination process in terms of federal
  and state privacy requirements. We will describe the vaccination process from
  the initial appointment, through the vaccination delivery, to the creation of
  subsequent required documentation. Although Python modules for PDF generation
  are common, they struggle with managing fillable forms where a fillable field
  may appear multiple times within the same form. Additionally, field types such
  as checkboxes, radio buttons, lists and combo boxes are not straightforward to
  programmatically fill. Another challenge is combining multiple filled forms
  while maintaining the integrity of the values of the fillable fields.
  Additionally, HIPAA compliance issues are discussed.
