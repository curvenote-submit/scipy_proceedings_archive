abstract: Characterizing dynamic sub-cellular morphologies in response to
  perturbation remains a challenging and important problem. Many organelles are
  anisotropic and difficult to segment, and few methods exist for quantifying
  the shape, size, and quantity of these organelles. The OrNet (Organelle
  Networks) framework models the diffuse organelle structures as social networks
  using graph theoretic and probabilistic approaches. Specifically, this
  architecture tracks the morphological changes in mitochondria because its
  structural changes offer insight into the adverse effects of pathogens on the
  host and aid the diagnosis and treatment of diseases; such as tuberculosis.
  The OrNet framework offers a segmentation pipeline to preprocess confocal
  imaging videos that display various mitochondrial morphologies into social
  network graphs. Earlier methods of anomaly detection in organelle structures
  include manual identification by researchers in the biology domain. Although
  those approaches were successful, manual classification is time consuming,
  tedious, and error-prone. Existing convolutional architectures do not have the
  capability to adapt to general graphs and fail to represent diffuse organelle
  morphologies due their amorphous characteristic. Thus, we propose the two
  different methods to perform classification on these organelles that captures
  their dynamic behaviors and identifies the fragmentation and fusion of
  mitochondria. One is a graph deep learning architecture, and the second is an
  approach that finds a graph representation for each social network and uses a
  traditional machine learning method for classification. Recent studies have
  demonstrated graph neural network models perform well on time-series imaging
  tasks, and the graph architectures are better able to represent amorphous and
  spatially diffuse structures such as mitochondria. Alternatively, much
  research has established traditional machine learning methods to be promising
  and robust models. Testing and comparing different architectures and models
  will effectively improve the robustness of categorizing distinct structural
  changes in subcellular organelle structures that is very useful for
  identifying infection patterns, offering a new way to understand cellular
  health and dynamic responses.
