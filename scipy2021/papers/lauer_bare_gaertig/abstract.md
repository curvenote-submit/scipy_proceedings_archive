abstract: This contribution shows how the symbolic computing Python library
  SymPy can be used to improve flow force modeling due to a Couette-type flow,
  i.e. a flow of viscous fluid in the region between two bodies, where one body
  is in tangential motion relative to the other. This motion imposes shear
  stresses on the fluid and leads to a corresponding fluid flow. The flow forces
  exerted on the moving component are of interest in many applications, for
  example in system simulations of electrohydraulic valves. There, an
  eccentrically mounted cylindrical core (the armature) moves within an
  oil-filled tube (the polecap), experiencing fluid forces due to the viscous
  oil. SymPy can help to understand the range of validity as well as the
  limitations of analytical relations that are commonly used as standard
  approximations for these type of forces in many leading system simulation
  tools. In order to motivate these approaches, this contribution elucidates how
  the velocity of the flow is determined analytically by solving the Stokes
  equation in an eccentric annulus with a conformal mapping-approach. Afterwards
  analytical postprocessing leads to the corresponding flow force. The results
  obtained with SymPy are then checked against full 3D computational fluid
  dynamics (CFD) simulations. This work concludes with the combination of new
  Couette flow force approximations and similar results for the known Poiseuille
  flow (i.e. fluid flow induced by a pressure difference) to derive new
  relations for a combined Couette-Poiseuille flow force. This article is
  addressed to natural scientists and engineers that are interested in the
  application of conformal mappings and Taylor-expansions with the help of SymPy
  when solving partial differential equations analytically.
