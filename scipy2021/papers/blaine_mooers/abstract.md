title: Modernizing computing by structural biologists with Jupyter and Colab
description: Protein crystallography produces most of the protein structures
  used in structure-based drug design. The process of protein structure
  determination is computationally intensive and error-prone because many
  software packages are involved.
abstract: Protein crystallography produces most of the protein structures used
  in structure-based drug design. The process of protein structure determination
  is computationally intensive and error-prone because many software packages
  are involved. Here, we attempt to support the reproducibility of this
  computational work by using Jupyter notebooks to document the decisions made,
  the code, and selected output. We have made libraries of code templates to
  ease running the crystallography packages in Jupyter notebooks when editing
  them with JupyterLab or Colab. Our combined use of GitHub, snippet libraries,
  Jupyter notebooks, JupyterLab, and Colab will help modernize the computing
  done by structural biologists.
