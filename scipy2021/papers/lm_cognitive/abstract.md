title: Programmatically Identifying Cognitive Biases Present in Software Development
description: Mitigating bias in AI-enabled systems is a topic of great concern
  within the research community. While efforts are underway to increase model
  interpretability and de-bias datasets, little attention has been given to
  identifying biases that are introduced by developers as part of the software
  engineering process.
abstract: "Mitigating bias in AI-enabled systems is a topic of great concern
  within the research community. While efforts are underway to increase model
  interpretability and de-bias datasets, little attention has been given to
  identifying biases that are introduced by developers as part of the software
  engineering process. To address this, we began developing an approach to
  identify a subset of cognitive biases that may be present in development
  artifacts: anchoring bias, availability bias, confirmation bias, and
  hyperbolic discounting. We developed multiple natural language processing
  (NLP) models to identify and classify the presence of bias in text originating
  from software development artifacts."
