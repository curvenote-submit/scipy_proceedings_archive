title: Using Python for Analysis and Verification of Mixed-mode Signal Chains
description: Any application involving sensitive measurements of the physical
  world starts with accurate, precise, and low-noise signal chain. Modern,
  highly integrated data acquisition devices can often be directly connected to
  sensor outputs, performing analog signal conditioning, digitization, and
  digital filtering on a single silicon device, greatly simplifying system
  electronics.

  However, a complete understanding of the signal chain's noise sources and
  noise limiting filters is still required to extract maximum performance from
  and debug these modern devices.
