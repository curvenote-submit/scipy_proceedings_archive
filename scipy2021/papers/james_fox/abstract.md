title: "PyCID: A Python Library for Causal Influence Diagrams"
description: Why did a decision maker select a certain decision? What behaviour
  does a certain objective incentivise? How can we improve this behaviour and
  ensure that a decision-maker chooses decisions with safer or fairer
  consequences? This paper introduces the Python package PyCID, built upon
  pgmpy, that implements (causal) influence diagrams, a widely used graphical
  modelling framework for decision-making problems.
abstract: Why did a decision maker select a certain decision? What behaviour
  does a certain objective incentivise? How can we improve this behaviour and
  ensure that a decision-maker chooses decisions with safer or fairer
  consequences? This paper introduces the Python package PyCID, built upon
  pgmpy, that implements (causal) influence diagrams, a widely used graphical
  modelling framework for decision-making problems. By providing a range of
  methods to solve and analyse (causal) influence diagrams, PyCID helps answer
  questions about behaviour and incentives in both single-agent and multi-agent
  settings.
