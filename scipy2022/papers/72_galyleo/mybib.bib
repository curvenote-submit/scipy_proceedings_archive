abstract = {Wikis are Web-based collaborative systems designed to help people share information. Wikis have become popular due to their openness which gives users complete control over the organization and the content of wiki pages. Unfortunately existing wiki engines restrict users to enter only passive content, such as text, graphics, and videos and do not allow users to customize wiki pages. Thus, wikis cannot be used to host or author rich dynamic and interactive content. In this paper we present Lively Wiki, a development and collaboration environment based on the Lively Kernel which enables users to create rich and interactive Web pages and applications - without leaving the Web. Lively Wiki combines the wiki metaphor with a direct-manipulation user interface and adds a concept for Web programming as well as programming tool support to create an easy to use, scalable, and extendable Web authoring tool. Moreover, Lively Wiki is self-supporting, i.e. the development tools were used for creating its own implementation thereby giving users the freedom to customize every aspect of the system.},

abstract = {Live Programming environments allow programmers to get feedback instantly while changing software. Liveness is gaining attention among industrial and open-source communities; several IDEs offer high degrees of liveness. While several studies looked at how programmers work during software evolution tasks, none of them consider live environments. We conduct such a study based on an analysis of 17 programming sessions of practitioners using Pharo, a mature Live Programming environment. The study is complemented by a survey and subsequent analysis of 16 programming sessions in additional languages, e.g., JavaScript. We document the approaches taken by developers during their work. We find that some liveness features are extensively used, and have an impact on the way developers navigate source code and objects in their work.},

When first built in 2006, it was a grand accomplishment to have created such a system that would run in any web browser. Since that time we have learned a lot about the goals we had, the challenges and opportunities that come with life in the browser, and the exciting possibilities that still lie ahead.},

Linear text does not do justice to such thoughts. But, it has been the dominant programming medium for the past and will remain so for the foreseeable future. This paper proposes a novel mechanism for conveniently extending textual programming languages with problem-specific visual syntax. It argues the necessity of this language feature, demonstrates the feasibility with a robust prototype, and sketches a design plan for adapting the idea to other languages.},

abstract = {Self is a new object-oriented language for exploratory programming based on a small number of simple and concrete ideas: prototypes, slots, and behavior. Prototypes combine inheritance and instantiation to provide a framework that is simpler and more flexible than most object-oriented languages. Slots unite variables and procedures into a single construct. This permits the inheritance hierarchy to take over the function of lexical scoping in conventional languages. Finally, because Self does not distinguish state from behavior, it narrows the gaps between ordinary objects, procedures, and closures. Self's simplicity and expressiveness offer new insights into object-oriented computation.},

Some of its new features are already being implemented by existing browsers, and much more is around the corner.Written by developers who have been using the new language for the past year in their work, this book shows you how to start adapting the language now to realize its benefits on todays browsers. Rather than being just an academic investigation, it concentrates on the practicalthe problems HTML5 can solve for you right away. By following the books hands-on HTML5 code examples youll learn:new semantics and structures to help your site become richer and more accessiblehow to apply the most important JavaScript APIs that are already implementedthe uses of native multimedia for video and audiotechniques for drawing lines, fills, gradients, images and text with canvas how to build more intelligent web formsimplementation of new storage options and web databaseshow geolocation works with HTML5 in both web and mobile applications********There appear to be intermittent problems with the first printing of Introducing HTML5.

abstract = {Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a novel representation-transparent approach to visualization for the web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},
