	abstract = {The matter in extreme conditions end station at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a new tool enabling accurate pump–probe measurements for studying the physical properties of matter in the high-energy density (HED) physics regime. This instrument combines the world’s brightest x-ray source, the LCLS x-ray beam, with high-power lasers consisting of two nanosecond Nd:glass laser beams and one short-pulse Ti:sapphire laser. These lasers produce short-lived states of matter with high pressures, high temperatures or high densities with properties that are important for applications in nuclear fusion research, laboratory astrophysics and the development of intense radiation sources. In the first experiments, we have performed highly accurate x-ray diffraction and x-ray Thomson scattering measurements on shock-compressed matter resolving the transition from compressed solid matter to a co-existence regime and into the warm dense matter state. These complex charged-particle systems are dominated by strong correlations and quantum effects. They exist in planetary interiors and laboratory experiments, e.g., during high-power laser interactions with solids or the compression phase of inertial confinement fusion implosions. Applying record peak brightness x-rays resolves the ionic interactions at atomic (Ångstrom) scale lengths and measure the static structure factor, which is a key quantity for determining equation of state data and important transport coefficients. Simultaneously, spectrally resolved measurements of plasmon features provide dynamic structure factor information that yield temperature and density with unprecedented precision at micron-scale resolution in dynamic compression experiments. These studies have demonstrated our ability to measure fundamental thermodynamic properties that determine the state of matter in the HED physics regime.}

abstract={Last year, at least 30,000 scientific papers used the Kohn--Sham scheme of density functional theory to solve electronic structure problems in a wide variety of scientific fields. Machine learning holds the promise of learning the energy functional via examples, bypassing the need to solve the Kohn--Sham equations. This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing larger systems and/or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. We perform the first molecular dynamics simulation with a machine-learned density functional on malonaldehyde and are able to capture the intramolecular proton transfer process. Learning density models now allows the construction of accurate density functionals for realistic molecular systems.},

abstract = "Motivated by the current high interest in the field of warm dense matter research, in this article we review the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature and over a broad density range relevant for warm dense matter applications. We provide an exhaustive overview of different simulation techniques, focusing on recent developments in the dielectric formalism (linear response theory) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Our primary focus is on two novel QMC methods that have recently allowed us to achieve breakthroughs in the thermodynamics of the warm dense electron gas: Permutation blocking path integral MC (PB-PIMC) and configuration path integral MC (CPIMC). In fact, a combination of PB-PIMC and CPIMC has allowed for a highly accurate description of the warm dense UEG over a broad density–temperature range. We are able to effectively avoid the notorious fermion sign problem, without invoking uncontrolled approximations such as the fixed node approximation. Furthermore, a new finite-size correction scheme is presented that makes it possible to treat the UEG in the thermodynamic limit without loss of accuracy. In addition, we in detail discuss the construction of a parametrization of the exchange–correlation free energy, on the basis of these data — the central thermodynamic quantity that provides a complete description of the UEG and is of crucial importance as input for the simulation of real warm dense matter applications, e.g., via thermal density functional theory. A second major aspect of this review is the use of our \textit{ab initio} simulation results to test previous theories, including restricted PIMC, finite-temperature Green functions, the classical mapping by Perrot and Dharma-wardana, and various dielectric methods such as the random phase approximation, or the Singwi–Tosi–Land–Sjölander (both in the static and quantum versions), Vashishta–Singwi and the recent Tanaka scheme for the local field correction. Thus, for the first time, thorough benchmarks of the accuracy of important approximation schemes regarding various quantities such as different energies, in particular the exchange–correlation free energy, and the static structure factor, are possible. In the final part of this paper, we outline a way how to rigorously extend our QMC studies to the inhomogeneous electron gas. We present first \textit{ab initio} data for the static density response and for the static local field correction.",

These results are compared to orbital-free molecular dynamics simulations and excellent agreement is found. Calculations of gII(r) with a simple version of the model (which we call the ion-sphere model) are in remarkable agreement with those of the full model. This ion-sphere model provides a simple and efficient method of calculating accurate gII(r) for warm and hot dense matter for many applications involving low- to high-Z elements with a modest investment of effort.}

abstract="Because the Hartree-Fock (HF) equations are non-linear in the molecular orbitals (MO's), they must be solved iteratively to obtain a self-consistent set of MO's (i.e. the SCF method). When iterations of the SCF process converge, the energy is stationary with respect to infinitesmal variations in the orbitals. Whether this stationary point is stable (a local minimum) or unstable (a maximum in one or more directions) depends on the second derivatives of the energy with respect to the orbital variations. The internal and external stabilities or instabilities of various constrained HF wavefunctions (real and complex, restricted, unrestricted and general HF) are discussed. A simple iterative scheme does not always lead to convergence of the SCF equations. The connection between SCF stability and convergence is examined and a number of methods for improving SCF convergence are discussed, including damping, level shifting, extrapolation, univariate search, direct inversion of iterative subspace (DIIS) and quadratically convergent SCF. Techniques for constructing better initial guess MO's are also considered.",

The new formulation improves upon previous treatments by explicitly including the ionic-structure factor. Calculations based on this new expression lead to much improved agreement with ab initio results for DC conductivity of warm dense hydrogen and beryllium, and for thermal conductivity of hydrogen. We also give and test a slightly modified Ziman–Evans formula for the resistivity that includes a non-free electron density of states, thus removing an ambiguity in the original Ziman–Evans formula. Again, results based on this expression are in good agreement with ab initio simulations for warm dense beryllium and hydrogen. However, for both these expressions, calculations of the electrical conductivity of warm dense aluminum lead to poor agreement at low temperatures compared to ab initio simulations.}

abstract = {Plane wave pseudopotential (PWP) density functional theory (DFT) calculation is the most widely used method for material simulations, but its absolute speed stagnated due to the inability to use large scale CPU based computers. By a drastic redesign of the algorithm, and moving all the major computation parts into GPU, we have reached a speed of 12s per molecular dynamics (MD) step for a 512 atom system using 256GPU cards. This is about 20 times faster than the CPU version of the code regardless of the number of CPU cores used. Our tests and analysis on different GPU platforms and configurations shed lights on the optimal GPU deployments for PWP-DFT calculations. An 1800 step MD simulation is used to study the liquid phase properties of GaInP.}

abstract = {We report on a source-code modification of the density-functional program suite VASP which benefits from the use of graphics-processing units (GPUs). For the electronic minimization needed to achieve the ground state using an implementation of the blocked Davidson iteration scheme (EDDAV), speed-ups of up to 3.39 on S1070 devices or 6.97 on a C2050 device were observed when calculating an ion–conductor system of actual research interest. Concerning the GPU specialty – memory throughput – the low double-precision performance forms the bottleneck on the S1070, whereas on Fermi cards the code reaches 61.7\% efficiency while not suffering from any accuracy losses compared to well-established calculations performed on a central processing unit (CPU). The algorithmic bottleneck was found to be the multiplication of rectangular matrices. An initial idea to solve this problem is given.}
