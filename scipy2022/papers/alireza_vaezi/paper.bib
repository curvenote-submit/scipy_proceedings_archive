  abstract     = {Segmenting three dimensional microscopy images is essential for understanding phenomena like morphogenesis, cell division, cellular growth and genetic expression patterns. Recently, deep learning (DL) pipelines have been developed which claim to provide high accuracy segmentation of cellular images and are increasingly considered as the state-of-the-art for image segmentation problems. However, it remains difficult to define their relative performance as the concurrent diversity and lack of uniform evaluation strategies makes it difficult to know how their results compare. In this paper, we first made an inventory of the available DL methods for 3D segmentation. We next implemented and quantitatively compared a number of representative DL pipelines, alongside a highly efficient non-DL method named MARS. The DL methods were trained on a common dataset of 3D cellular confocal microscopy images. Their segmentation accuracies were also tested in the presence of different image artifacts. A new method for segmentation quality evaluation was adopted which isolates segmentation errors due to under/over segmentation. This is complemented with new visualization strategies that make interactive exploration of segmentation quality possible. Our analysis shows that the DL pipelines have very different levels of accuracy. Two of them show high performance, and offer clear advantages in terms of adaptability to new data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract     = {Quantitative analysis of plant and animal morphogenesis requires accurate segmentation of individual cells in volumetric images of growing organs. In the last years, deep learning has provided robust automated algorithms that approach human performance, with applications to bio-image analysis now starting to emerge. Here, we present PlantSeg, a pipeline for volumetric segmentation of plant tissues into cells. PlantSeg employs a convolutional neural network to predict cell boundaries and graph partitioning to segment cells based on the neural network predictions. PlantSeg was trained on fixed and live plant organs imaged with confocal and light sheet microscopes. PlantSeg delivers accurate results and generalizes well across different tissues, scales, acquisition settings even on non plant samples. We present results of PlantSeg applications in diverse developmental contexts. PlantSeg is free and open-source, with both a command line and a user-friendly graphical interface.},
