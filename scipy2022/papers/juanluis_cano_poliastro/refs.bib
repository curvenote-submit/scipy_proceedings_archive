Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight some recent technical developments.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
             
              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves 
              1 
              and in the first imaging of a black hole 
              2 
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

For the basic static models, tables are given for heights from 90 to 2500 km and for exospheric temperatures from 500 to 2600 K.

              cost of the transfer of a spacecraft subject to a low-thrust action. The equations represent an extension of solutions already available in the literature. Moreover, the paper presents novel analytical solutions for low-thrust transfers under the effect of the second-order zonal harmonics of the Earth’s gravitational potential. In particular, the paper is divided into two parts. The first part presents analytical expressions for the
              
                
                  \$\${\textbackslash}Delta V\$\$

              cost of transfers. All analytical equations were validated through numerical integration of the dynamics of the spacecraft. The second part of the paper introduces new analytical equations for low-thrust transfers between circular inclined orbits with different values of the right ascension of the ascending node, under the effect of the second-order zonal harmonic of the Earth’s gravitational potential. Both in the first and second parts, analytic solutions for the variation with time of the orbital elements during the transfer are presented. The proposed equations are applicable to low-thrust transfer realised through a long spiral trajectory.},

For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (
              i
              ) requesting data and code from authors and (
              ii
              ) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal
              Science
              after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44\% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%. We find this policy—author remission of data and code postpublication upon request—an improvement over no policy, but currently insufficient for reproducibility.},

	abstract = {Mubody is an astrodynamics open-source Python library focused on the libration points. Such points result from the equilibrium of the gravitational forces between two massive bodies as the Sun and Earth, for example. The library is mainly aimed at the generation of orbits in these regions, which is not a straightforward process, specially if perturbations are considered. Currently, the library allows to generate Lissajous orbits in the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth system under the influence of perturbations such as the Earth orbit eccentricity. The next milestone, as a result of a master student work, is the incorporation of Halo orbits and the expansion to all three collinear libration points from any two massive bodies of the Solar System. This tool has been developed as part of a PhD, motivated by the need of performing mission analysis in libration point regions. Nevertheless, since its creation it has also proven to be an excellent academic tool for both enhancing the library itself and using its results for further studies (collision risk, thermal analysis, formation flight control, etc). As a result, the tool has rapidly evolved, building onto the knowledge and experience that the students gather while working on their academic projects (bachelor’s degree dissertations, master theses, subjects, internships). The participation on the library development provides students with experience in orbital mechanics, software design, version control and it compels them to ensure that their work can be readily used by others as it is properly documented. The project is hosted in GitLab under a MIT licence.},
