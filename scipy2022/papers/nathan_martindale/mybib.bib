  abstract = {The growing popularity of machine learning (ML) applications has led to the introduction of software engineering tools such as Data Versioning Control (DVC), MLFlow and Pachyderm that enable versioning ML data, models, pipelines and model evaluation metrics. Since these versioned ML artifacts need to be synchronized not only with each other, but also with the source and test code of the software applications into which the models are integrated, prior findings on co-evolution and coupling between software artifacts might need to be revisited. Hence, in order to understand the degree of coupling between ML-related and other software artifacts, as well as the adoption of ML versioning features, this paper empirically studies the usage of DVC in 391 Github projects, 25 of which in detail. Our results show that more than half of the DVC files in a project are changed at least once every one-tenth of the project's lifetime. Furthermore, we observe a tight coupling between DVC files and other artifacts, with 1/4 pull requests changing source code and 1/2 pull requests changing tests requiring a change to DVC files. As additional evidence of the observed complexity associated with adopting ML-related software engineering tools like DVC, an average of 78\% of the studied projects showed a non-constant trend in pipeline complexity.},

  abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.     In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included.  A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric.  Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.},

Today there are many workflow systems, often with overlapping functionality. A key issue for potential users of work- flow systems is the need to be able to compare the capabilities of the various available tools. There can be confusion about system functionality and the tools are often selected without a proper functional analysis. In this paper we extract a taxonomy of features from the way sci- entists make use of existing workflow systems and we illustrate this feature set by providing some examples taken from existing workflow systems. The taxonomy provides end users with a mechanism by which they can assess the suitability of workflow in general and how they might use these features to make an informed choice about which workflow system would be a good choice for their particular application.},

It is also hard to move from an experimental environment to production. Operational workflows such as containerization, continuous deployment, and cloud orchestration allow data science researchers to move a pipeline from a local environment to the cloud. Being aware of the difficulties of setting those workflows up, this paper presents a framework to ease experiment tracking and operationalizing machine learning by combining existent and well-supported technologies. These technologies include Docker, Mlflow, Ray, among others. The framework provides an opinionated workflow to design and execute experiments either on a local environment or the cloud. ml-experiment includes: an automatic tracking system for the most famous machine learning libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, Fastai, Xgboost and Lightgdm, first-class support for distributed training and hyperparameter optimization, and a Command Line Interface (CLI) for packaging and running projects inside containers.},

Hypotheses: 1) AI research is not documented well enough to reproduce the reported results. 2) Documentation practices have improved over time. Method: The literature is reviewed and a set of variables that should be documented to enable reproducibility are grouped into three factors: Experiment, Data and Method. The metrics describe how well the factors have been documented for a paper. A total of 400 research papers from the conference series IJCAI and AAAI have been surveyed using the metrics. Findings: None of the papers document all of the variables. The metrics show that between 20\% and 30\% of the variables for each factor are documented. One of the metrics show statistically significant increase over time while the others show no change. Interpretation: The reproducibility scores decrease with in- creased documentation requirements. Improvement over time is found. Conclusion: Both hypotheses are supported.},

Rapidly evolving data, such as data streams changing during a disease outbreak, are particularly challenging. Data management is further complicated by data being imprecisely identified when used. Public trust in policy decisions resulting from such analyses is easily damaged and is often low, with cynicism arising where claims of "following the science" are made without accompanying evidence. Tracing the provenance of such decisions back through open software to primary data would clarify this evidence, enhancing the transparency of the decision-making process. Here, we demonstrate a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data pipeline developed during the COVID-19 pandemic that allows easy annotation of data as they are consumed by analyses, while tracing the provenance of scientific outputs back through the analytical source code to data sources. Such a tool provides a mechanism for the public, and fellow scientists, to better assess the trust that should be placed in scientific evidence, while allowing scientists to support policy-makers in openly justifying their decisions. We believe that tools such as this should be promoted for use across all areas of policy-facing research.},

We make the following observation: All of these approaches require a robust understanding of the relationship between ML models and the data used to train them. In this work, we introduce the ML provenance tracking problem: the fundamental idea is to automatically track which columns in a dataset have been used to derive the features/labels of an ML model. We discuss the challenges in capturing such information in the context of Python, the most common language used by data scientists. We then present Vamsa, a modular system that extracts provenance from Python scripts without requiring any changes to the users' code. Using 26K real data science scripts, we verify the effectiveness of Vamsa in terms of coverage, and performance. We also evaluate Vamsa's accuracy on a smaller subset of manually labeled data. Our analysis shows that Vamsa's precision and recall range from 90.4\% to 99.1\% and its latency is in the order of milliseconds for average size scripts. Drawing from our experience in deploying ML models in production, we also present an example in which Vamsa helps automatically identify models that are affected by data corruption issues.},

Capturing data lineage, metadata, and other artifacts helps reproducing and sharing experimental results. We summarize this challenge as automated documentation of data science experiments. We aim at reducing manual overhead for experimenting researchers, and intend to create a novel approach in dataflow and metadata tracking based on the analysis of the experiment source code. The envisioned system will accelerate the research process in general, and enable capturing fine-grained meta information by deriving a declarative representation of data science experiments.},

The success of complex Neural Network models depends upon many factors, as the requirement for structured and machine learning-centric project development management arises.

In this work, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) technologies and tools for every part of the overall project pipeline, as well as involved roles, are examined and clearly defined. With the focus on the inter-connectivity of specific tools and comparison by well-selected requirements of MLOps, model performance, input data, and system quality metrics are briefly discussed. By identifying aspects of machine learning, which can be reused from project to project, open-source tools which help in specific parts of the pipeline, and possible combinations, an overview of support in MLOps is given. Deep learning has revolutionized the field of Image processing, and building an automated machine learning workflow for object detection is of great interest for many organizations. For this, a simple MLOps workflow for object detection with images is portrayed.},

This paper will first discuss the problems we have encountered while building a variety of machine learning models, and subsequently describe the framework we built to tackle the problem of model reproducibility. The framework is comprised of four main components (data, feature, scoring, and evaluation layers), which are themselves comprised of well defined transformations. This enables us to not only exactly replicate a model, but also to reuse the transformations across different models. As a result, the platform has dramatically increased the speed of both offline and online experimentation while also ensuring model reproducibility.},

  abstract = {There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders\textemdash representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers\textemdash have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of high-throughput technologies has transformed biomedical research. With the increasing amount and complexity of data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not just for experiments, but also for computational analysis. However, transforming data into information involves running a large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline development, optimize resource usage, handle software installation and versions, and run on different compute platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers, compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows, and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users. We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum, we illustrate how workflow managers contribute to making computational analysis in biomedical research shareable, scalable, and reproducible.},
