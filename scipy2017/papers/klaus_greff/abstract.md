  We present a toolchain for computational research consisting of
  `Sacred` and two supporting tools. `Sacred` is an open source Python framework
  which aims to provide basic infrastructure for running computational
  experiments independent of the methods and libraries used. Instead, it focuses
  on solving universal everyday problems, such as managing configurations,
  reproducing results, and bookkeeping. Moreover, it provides an extensible
  basis for other tools, two of which we present here: `Labwatch` helps with
  tuning hyperparameters, and `Sacredboard` provides a web-dashboard for
  organizing and analyzing runs and results.
