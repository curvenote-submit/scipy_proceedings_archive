abstract: |
  `BespON` is a human-editable data format focused on expressive syntax,
  lossless round-tripping, and advanced features for scientific and technical
  tasks. Nested data structures can be represented concisely without multiple
  levels of either brackets or significant whitespace. The open-source Python
  implementation of `BespON` can modify data values while otherwise perfectly
  preserving config file layout, including comments. `BespON` also provides doc
  comments that can be preserved through arbitrary data modification. Additional
  features include integers (binary, octal, decimal, and hex), floats (decimal
  and hex, including Infinity and NaN), multiline string literals that only
  preserve indentation relative to delimiters, and an extensible design that can
  support user-defined data types.
