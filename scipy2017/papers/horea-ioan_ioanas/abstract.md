  `LabbookDB` is a relational database application framework for life
  sciences—providing an extendable schema and functions to conveniently add and
  retrieve information, and generate summaries. The core concept of `LabbookDB` is
  that wet work metadata commonly tracked in lab books or spreadsheets is more
  efficiently and more reliably stored in a relational database, and more
  flexibly queried. We overcome the flexibility limitations of
  designed-for-analysis spreadsheets and databases by building our schema around
  atomized physical object interactions in the laboratory (and providing
  plotting- and/or analysis-ready dataframes as a compatibility layer). We keep
  our database schema more easily extendable and adaptable by using joined table
  inheritance to manage polymorphic objects and their relationships. `LabbookDB`
  thus provides a wet work metadata storage model excellently suited for
  explorative ex-post reporting and analysis, as well as a potential
  infrastructure for automated wet work tracking.
