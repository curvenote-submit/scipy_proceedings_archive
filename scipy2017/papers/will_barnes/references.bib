  abstract = {We present version 8 of the CHIANTI database. This version includes a large amount of new data and ions, which represent a significant improvement in the soft X-ray, extreme UV (EUV) and UV spectral regions, which several space missions currently cover. New data for neutrals and low charge states are also added. The data are assessed, but to improve the modelling of low-temperature plasma the effective collision
strengths for most of the new datasets are not spline-fitted as
previously, but are retained as calculated. This required a change of the format of the CHIANTI electron excitation files. The format of the energy files has also been changed. Excitation rates between all the levels are retained for most of the new datasets, so the data can in principle be used to model high-density plasma. In addition, the method for computing the differential emission measure used in the CHIANTI software has been changed.},

  abstract = {The CHIANTI database was described by Dere et al. (1997, hereafter Paper 
I) and the present paper applies the atomic data to the study of extreme
ultra-violet emission lines found in the SERTS-89 active region spectrum
published by Thomas \& Neupert (1994). Firstly, the emission line
ratios that are insensitive to density and temperature are used to check
both the quality of the atomic data and the calibration of the
instrument. Secondly, we use, where possible, ratios that are sensitive
to density to estimate the electron density from different ions. In
general we find excellent agreement between theory and observation,
providing confidence in both the atomic data in the CHIANTI database and
the quality of the SERTS-89 spectrum. Where inconsistencies between
theory and observation exist we try to explain them in terms of either
inaccuracies in the atomic data or blending of the lines. One consistent
discrepancy was that all observed lines that we analysed in the
lambr\{430\}\{450\} region were uniformly a factor of 1.5--2.0 weaker than
predicted, suggesting that the SERTS-89 calibration may need adjustment
in this spectral interval. Serious problems were also found in some of
the theoretical predictions for a few ions, especially ion\{Fe\}\{xiv\}.},

predictions to off-disk spectral observations of the solar corona
between 500 and 1500 {\AA}. The observed spectra were recorded by the
SUMER instrument on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory using
the full spectral range allowed by the instrument. Earlier works have
demonstrated that the particular emitting plasma is isothermal at a
temperature of 1.35\texttimes{}106 K, making it ideal for the
assessment of the accuracy of the CHIANTI database. This assessment of
the CHIANTI database allowed us (1) to select lines and ions for which
the agreement between theory and observation is good, (2) to identify
several lines which are blended, and (3) to stress inconsistencies
between a few lines and theory, thus showing where improvements to
atomic data and transition probabilities are necessary.},

extended to allow nine-point spline fits in addition to the previous
five-point spline fits. This allows higher quality fits to data from
close-coupling calculations where resonances can lead to significant

photoexcitation and stimulated emission by a blackbody radiation field
in a spherical geometry on the level balance equations of the CHIANTI
ions can now be studied following modifications to the CHIANTI software.

been added to CHIANTI. Many updates to existing ion data sets are
described, while several new ions have been added to the database,
including Ar IV, Fe VI, and Ni XXI. The two-photon continuum is now

SunPy is a data-analysis environment specializing in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It
currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and
STEREO/SWAVES. We describe SunPy's functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools already available in Python.

It contains data and software for modeling optically thin atom and positive ion emission from low density ($\lessequivlnt$10 13 cm -3 ) plasmas from x-ray to infrared wavelengths. A key feature is that the data are assessed and regularly updated, with version 8 released in 2015. Atomic data for modeling the emissivities of 246 ions and neutrals are contained in CHIANTI, together with data for deriving the ionization fractions of all elements up to zinc. The different types of atomic data are summarized here and their formats discussed. Statistics on the impact of CHIANTI to the astrophysical community are given and examples of the diverse range of applications are presented.},

  abstract = {Aims: The goal of the CHIANTI atomic database is to provide a set of 
atomic data for the interpretation of astrophysical spectra emitted by
collisionally dominated, high temperature, optically thin sources. Methods: A complete set of ground level ionization and recombination
rate coefficients has been assembled for all atoms and ions of the
elements of H through Zn and inserted into the latest version of the
CHIANTI database, CHIANTI 6. Ionization rate coefficients are taken from
the recent work of Dere (2007, A\&A, 466, 771) and recombination
rates from a variety of sources in the literature. These new rate
coefficients have allowed the calculation of a new set of ionization
equilibria and radiative loss rate coefficients. For some ions, such as
Fe VIII and Fe IX, there are significant differences from previous
calculations. In addition, existing atomic parameters have been revised
and new atomic parameters inserted into the database. Results:
For each ion in the CHIANTI database, elemental abundances, ionization
potentials, atomic energy levels, radiative rates, electron and proton
collisional rate coefficients, ionization and recombination rate
coefficients, and collisional ionization equilibrium populations are
provided. In addition, parameters for the calculation of the continuum
due to bremsstrahlung, radiative recombination and two-photon decay are
provided. A suite of programs written in the Interactive Data Language
(IDL) are available to calculate line and continuum emissivities and
other properties. All data and programs are freely available at

We first determine the thermal structure of the observed plasma, and

quality of CHIANTI atomic data by comparing predicted emissivities with
observed intensities. We identify several lines never observed before in
solar spectra, and find an overall very good agreement between
CHIANTI-predicted emissivities and observations.},

show strongly enhanced lines from the upper solar transition region
(temperatures 5.4 $<$= log T $<$= 5.9) allowing a number of new line
identifications to be made. Comparisons of Fe VII lines with predictions
from a new atomic model reveal new plasma diagnostics, however there are
a number of disagreements between theory and observation for emission
line ratios insensitive to density and temperature, suggesting improved
atomic data are required. Line ratios for Fe VIII also show
discrepancies with theory, with the strong $\lambda$185.21 and
$\lambda$186.60 lines underestimated by 60\%-80\% compared to lines between
192 and 198 {\AA}. A newly identified multiplet between 253.9 and
255.8 {\AA} offers excellent temperature diagnostic opportunities
relative to the lines between 185 and 198 {\AA}, however the atomic
model underestimates the strength of these lines by factors of 3-6. Two
new line identifications are made for Fe IX at wavelengths 176.959
{\AA} and 177.594 {\AA}, while seven other lines between 186 and 200

identifications cannot be made. The new atomic data for Fe VII and Fe IX
are demonstrated to significantly modify models for the response
function of the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer 195 {\AA}
imaging channel, affecting temperature determinations from this channel.
The data will also affect the response functions for other solar EUV
imaging instruments such as SOHO/EIT, STEREO/EUVI, and the upcoming AIA
instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory.},

Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), currently under construction on Haleakal{\=a}, in Maui, Hawai'i will be the largest solar telescope in the world and will use adaptive optics to provide the highest resolution view of the Sun to date. It is expected that DKIST data will enable significant and transformative discoveries that will dramatically increase our understanding of the Sun and its effects on the Sun-Earth environment. As a result of this, it is a priority of the DKIST Data Center team at the National Solar Observatory (NSO) to be able to deliver timely and accurately calibrated data to the astronomical community for further analysis. This will require a process which allows the Data Center to develop calibration pipelines for all of the facility instruments, taking advantage of similarities between them, as well as similarities to current generation instruments. There will also be a challenges which are addressed in this article, such as the large volume of data expected, and the importance of supporting both manual and automated calibrations. This paper will detail the current calibration development strategies being used by the Data Center team at the National Solar Observatory to manage this calibration effort, so as to ensure delivery of high quality scientific data routinely to users.},
