  `ChiantiPy` is an interface to the CHIANTI atomic database for
  astrophysical spectroscopy. The highly-cited CHIANTI project, now in its 20th
  year, is an invaluable resource to the solar physics community. The `ChiantiPy`
  project brings the power of the scientific Python stack to the CHIANTI
  database, allowing solar physicists and astronomers to easily make use of this
  atomic data and calculate commonly used quantities from it such as radiative
  loss rates and emissivities for particular atomic transitions.

  This paper will
  discuss the capabilities of the CHIANTI database and the `ChiantiPy` project as
  well as the current state of the project and its place in the solar physics
  community. We will demonstrate how the core modules in `ChiantiPy` can be used
  to study emission from optically thin transitions and the continuum in the
  x-ray and EUV wavelengths. Additionally, we will discuss some of the
  infrastructure around the `ChiantiPy` project and some of the goals for the near
  future.
