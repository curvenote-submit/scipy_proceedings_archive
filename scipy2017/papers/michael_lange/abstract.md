title: Optimised finite difference computation from symbolic equations
description: Domain-specific high-productivity environments are playing an
  increasingly important role in scientific computing due to the levels of
  abstraction and automation they provide. In this paper we introduce Devito, an
  open-source domain-specific framework for solving partial differential
  equations from symbolic problem definitions by the finite difference method.
abstract: Domain-specific high-productivity environments are playing an
  increasingly important role in scientific computing due to the levels of
  abstraction and automation they provide. In this paper we introduce `Devito`, an
  open-source domain-specific framework for solving partial differential
  equations from symbolic problem definitions by the finite difference method.
  We highlight the generation and automated execution of highly optimized
  stencil code from only a few lines of high-level symbolic Python for a set of
  scientific equations, before exploring the use of `Devito` operators in seismic
  inversion problems.
