title: 'pyMolDyn: Identification, structure, and properties of cavities in
  condensed matter and molecules'
description: pyMolDyn is an interactive viewer of atomic systems defined in a
  unit cell and is particularly useful for crystalline and amorphous materials.
  It identifies and visualizes cavities (vacancies, voids) in simulation cells
  corresponding to all seven 3D Bravais lattices, makes no assumptions about
  cavity shapes, allows for atoms of different size, and locates the cavity
  centers (the centers of the largest spheres not including an atom center).

  `pyMolDyn` is an interactive viewer of atomic systems defined in a unit
  cell and is particularly useful for crystalline and amorphous materials. It
  identifies and visualizes cavities (vacancies, voids) in simulation cells
  corresponding to all seven 3D Bravais lattices, makes no assumptions about
  cavity shapes, allows for atoms of different size, and locates the cavity
  centers (the centers of the largest spheres not including an atom center). We
  define three types of cavity and develop a method based on the split and merge
  algorithm to calculate all three. The visualization of the cavities uses the
  marching cubes algorithm. The program allows one to calculate and export pair
  distribution functions (between atoms and/or cavities), as well as bonding and
  dihedral angles, cavity volumes and surface areas, and measures of cavity
  shapes, including asphericity, acylindricity, and relative shape anisotropy.
  The open source Python program is based on GR framework and GR3 routines and
  can be used to generate high resolution graphics and videos.
