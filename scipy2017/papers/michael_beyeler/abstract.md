  By 2020 roughly 200 million people worldwide will suffer from
  photoreceptor diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular
  degeneration, and a variety of retinal sight restoration technologies are
  being developed to target these diseases.

  One technology, analogous to
  cochlear implants, uses a grid of electrodes to stimulate remaining retinal
  cells. Two brands of retinal prostheses are currently approved for
  implantation in patients with late stage photoreceptor disease. Clinical
  experience with these implants has made it apparent that the vision restored
  by these devices differs substantially from normal sight. 

  To better understand
  the outcomes of this technology, we developed `pulse2percept`, an open-source
  Python implementation of a computational model that predicts the perceptual
  experience of retinal prosthesis patients across a wide range of implant
  configurations. A modular and extensible user interface exposes the different
  building blocks of the software, making it easy for users to simulate novel
  implants, stimuli, and retinal models. 

  We hope that this library will
  contribute substantially to the field of medicine by providing a tool to
  accelerate the development of visual prostheses.
