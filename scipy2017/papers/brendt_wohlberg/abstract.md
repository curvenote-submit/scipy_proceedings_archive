title: "SPORCO: A Python package for standard and convolutional sparse
  representations"
description: SParse Optimization Research COde (SPORCO) is an open-source Python
  package for solving optimization problems with sparsity-inducing
  regularization, consisting primarily of sparse coding and dictionary learning,
  for both standard and convolutional forms of sparse representation.
abstract: SParse Optimization Research COde (SPORCO) is an open-source Python
  package for solving optimization problems with sparsity-inducing
  regularization, consisting primarily of sparse coding and dictionary learning,
  for both standard and convolutional forms of sparse representation. In the
  current version, all optimization problems are solved within the Alternating
  Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework. SPORCO was developed for
  applications in signal and image processing, but is also expected to be useful
  for problems in computer vision, statistics, and machine learning.
