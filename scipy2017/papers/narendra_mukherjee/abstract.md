title: 'Python meets systems neuroscience: affordable, scalable and open-source
  electrophysiology in awake, behaving rodents'
description: 'In-vivo electrophysiology, the recording of neurons in the brains
  of awake, behaving animals, is currently undergoing paradigm shifts. There is
  a push towards moving to open-source technologies that can: 1) be adjusted to
  specific experiments; 2) be shared with ease; and 3) more affordably record
  from larger numbers of electrodes simultaneously.'

  In-vivo electrophysiology, the recording of neurons in the brains of
  awake, behaving animals, is currently undergoing paradigm shifts. There is a
  push towards moving to open-source technologies that can:

  1. be adjusted to specific experiments;
  1. be shared with ease; and
  1. more affordably record from larger numbers of electrodes simultaneously.

  Here we describe our
  construction of a system that satisfies these three desirable properties using
  the scientific Python stack and Linux. Using a Raspberry Pi to control
  experimental paradigms, we build a completely open-source, HDF5-based analysis
  (spike sorting) toolkit in Python. 

  This toolkit can be easily parallelized and
  scales to incorporate increasing electrode counts and longer recordings. Our
  rig costs about $5000, an order of magnitude less than many comparable
  commercially available electrophysiology systems.
