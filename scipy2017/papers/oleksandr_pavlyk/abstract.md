title: Accelerating Scientific Python with Intel Optimizations
description: It is well-known that the performance difference between Python and
  basic C code can be up 200x, but for numerically intensive code another
  speed-up factor of 240x or even greater is possible. The performance comes
  from software's ability to take advantage of CPU's multiple cores, single
  instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions, and high performance caches.
abstract: It is well-known that the performance difference between Python and
  basic C code can be up 200x, but for numerically intensive code another
  speed-up factor of 240x or even greater is possible. The performance comes
  from software's ability to take advantage of CPU's multiple cores, single
  instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions, and high performance caches.
  The article describes optimizations, included in IntelÂ® Distribution for
  Python, aimed to automatically boost performance of numerically intensive
  code. This paper is intended for Python programmers who want to get the most
  out of their hardware but do not have time or expertise to re-code their
  applications using techniques such as native extensions or Cython.
