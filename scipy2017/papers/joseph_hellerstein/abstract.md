  Digital spreadsheets are arguably the most pervasive environment for
  end user programming on the planet. Although spreadsheets simplify many
  calculations, they fail to address requirements for expressivity, reuse,
  complex data, and performance. SciSheets (from "scientific
  spreadsheets") is an open source project that provides novel
  features to address these requirements: 

  1. formulas can be arbitrary Python
  scripts as well as expressions (formula scripts), which addresses expressivity
  by allowing calculations to be written as algorithms;
  1. spreadsheets can be exported as functions in a Python module (function export), which addresses
  reuse since exported codes can be reused in formulas and/or by external
  programs and improves performance since calculations can execute in a low
  overhead environment; and 
  1. tables can have columns that are themselves
  tables (subtables), which addresses complex data such as representing
  hierarchically structured data and n-to-m relationships. 

  Our future directions
  include refinements to subtables, github integration, and plotting. At
  present, SciSheets can do robust demos, but it is not yet beta code.
