abstract: Pattern matching is a powerful tool for symbolic computations, based
  on the well-defined theory of term rewriting systems. Application domains
  include algebraic expressions, abstract syntax trees, and XML and JSON data.
  Unfortunately, no lightweight implementation of pattern matching as general
  and flexible as Mathematica exists for Python `Mathics`, `MacroPy`, `patterns`, `PyPatt`.
  Therefore, we created the open source module `MatchPy` which offers similar
  pattern matching functionality in Python using a novel algorithm which finds
  matches for large pattern sets more efficiently by exploiting similarities
  between patterns.
