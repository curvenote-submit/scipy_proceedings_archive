  In audio-visual automatic speech recognition (AVASR) both acoustic and visual
  modalities of speech are used to identify what a person is saying. In this
  paper we propose a basic AVASR system implemented using SciPy, an open source
  Python library for scientific computing. AVASR research draws from the fields
  of signal processing, computer vision and machine learning, all of which are
  active fields of development in the SciPy community. As such, AVASR
  researchers using SciPy are able to benefit from a wide range of tools
  available in SciPy.


  The performance of the system is tested using the Clemson University
  audio-visual experiments (CUAVE) database. We find that visual speech
  information is in itself not sufficient for automatic speech recognition.
  However, by integrating visual and acoustic speech information we are able to
  obtain better performance than what is possible with audio-only ASR.
