  and data visualization.
abstract: Python along with various numerical and scientific libraries was used
  to create tools that enable fire protection engineers to perform various
  calculations and tasks including educational instruction, experimental work,
  and data visualization. Examples of web calculators and tools for creating 3D
  geometry for fire models using Python are presented. The use of Python in the
  fire research field will foster many new ideas, tools, and innovation in the
  field of fire protection research and engineering.
