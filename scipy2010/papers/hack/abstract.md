title: Using Python with Smoke and JWST Mirrors
description: We will describe how the Space Telescope Science Institute is using
  Python in support of the next large space telescope, the James Webb Space
  Telescope (JWST). We will briefly describe the 6.5 meter segmented-mirror
  infra-red telescope, currently planned for a 2014 launch, and its science
  goals.
abstract: We will describe how the Space Telescope Science Institute is using
  Python in support of the next large space telescope, the James Webb Space
  Telescope (JWST). We will briefly describe the 6.5 meter segmented-mirror
  infra-red telescope, currently planned for a 2014 launch, and its science
  goals. Our experience with Python has already been employed to study the
  variation of the mirror and instrument support structures during cyrogenic
  cool-down from ambient temperatures to 30 Kelvin with accuracies better than
  10 nanometers using a speckle interferometer. Python was used to monitor,
  process (initially in near real-time) and analyze over 15 TB of data
  collected. We are currently planning a metrology test that will collect 10 TB
  of data in 7 minutes. We will discuss the advantages of using Python for each
  of these projects.
