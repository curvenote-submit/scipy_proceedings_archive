title: Data Structures for Statistical Computing in Python
description: In this paper we are concerned with the practical issues of working
  with data sets common to finance, statistics, and other related fields. pandas
  is a new library which aims to facilitate working with these data sets and to
  provide a set of fundamental building blocks for implementing statistical
  models.
abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the practical issues of working
  with data sets common to finance, statistics, and other related fields. pandas
  is a new library which aims to facilitate working with these data sets and to
  provide a set of fundamental building blocks for implementing statistical
  models. We will discuss specific design issues encountered in the course of
  developing pandas with relevant examples and some comparisons with the R
  language. We conclude by discussing possible future directions for statistical
  computing and data analysis using Python.
