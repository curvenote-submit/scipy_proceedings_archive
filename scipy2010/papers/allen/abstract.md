abstract: The astrodata package is a part of the Gemini Telescope's python-based
  Data Reduction Suite. It is designed to help us deal in a normalized way with
  data from a variety of instruments and instrument-modes. All Gemini specific
  code configurations are isolated in configuration packages separate from the
  astrodata source. The configuration packages define a lexicon of terms
  associated with a family of dataset types and implements the behaviors
  associated with each terms.
