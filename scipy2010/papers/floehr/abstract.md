abstract: ForecastWatch is a weather forecast verification and accuracy analysis
  system that collects over 70,000 weather forecasts per day. The system
  consists of data capture, verification, aggregation, audit and display
  components. All components are written in Python. The display component
  consists of two websites, ForecastWatch.com, the commercial offering, and
  ForecastAdvisor.com, the free consumer version, both implemented using the
  Django web application framework. In addition to providing comparative
  forecast accuracy analysis to commercial weather forecast providers like The
  Weather Channel, ForecastWatch data and systems have been instrumental in a
  number of research endeavors. Dr. Eric Bickel, of the University of Texas at
  Austin, Dr. Bruce Rose of The Weather Channel, and Jungmin Lee of Florida
  International University have published research using data from ForecastWatch
  and software written by Intellovations.
