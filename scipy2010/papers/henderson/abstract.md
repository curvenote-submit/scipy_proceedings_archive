  The popular Sudoku puzzles which appear daily in newspapers the world over
  have, lately, attracted the attention of mathematicians and computer
  scientists. There are many, difficult, unsolved problems about Sudoku puzzles
  and their generalizations which make them especially interesting to
  mathematicians. Also, as is well-known, the generalization of the Sudoku
  puzzle to larger dimension is an NP-complete problem and therefore of
  substantial interest to computer scientists.


  In this article we discuss the modeling of Sudoku puzzles in a variety of
  different mathematical domains. We show how to use existing third-party Python
  libraries to implement these models. Those implementations, which include
  translations into the domains of constraint satisfaction, integer programming,
  polynomial calculus and graph theory, are available in an open-source Python
  library sudoku.py developed by the authors and available at
