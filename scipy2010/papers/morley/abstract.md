  Space science deals with the bodies within the solar system and the
  interplanetary medium; the primary focus is on atmospheres and above—at Earth
  the short timescale variation in the the geomagnetic field, the Van Allen
  radiation belts and the deposition of energy into the upper atmosphere are key
  areas of investigation.


  SpacePy is a package for Python, targeted at the space sciences, that aims to
  make basic data analysis, modeling and visualization easier. It builds on the
  capabilities of the well-known NumPy and matplotlib packages. Publication
  quality output direct from analyses is emphasized. The SpacePy project seeks
  to promote accurate and open research standards by providing an open
  environment for code development. In the space physics community there has
  long been a significant reliance on proprietary languages that restrict free
  transfer of data and reproducibility of results. By providing a comprehensive
  library of widely-used analysis and visualization tools in a free, modern and
  intuitive language, we hope that this reliance will be diminished for
  non-commercial users.


  SpacePy includes implementations of widely used empirical models, statistical
  techniques used frequently in space science (e.g. superposed epoch analysis),
  and interfaces to advanced tools such as electron drift shell calculations for
  radiation belt studies. SpacePy also provides analysis and visualization tools
  for components of the Space Weather Modeling Framework including streamline
  tracing in vector fields. Further development is currently underway. External
  libraries, which include well-known magnetic field models, high-precision time
  conversions and coordinate transformations are accessed from Python using
  ctypes and f2py. The rest of the tools have been implemented directly in
  Python.


  The provision of open-source tools to perform common tasks will provide
  openness in the analysis methods employed in scientific studies and will give
  access to advanced tools to all space scientists, currently distribution is
  limited to non-commercial use.
