  astronomical data since its launch by NASA in July of 1999. Now starting the
  second decade of science the Chandra operations team has been using Python to
  create predictive thermal models of key spacecraft components.
abstract: The Chandra X-ray Observatory has been providing groundbreaking
  astronomical data since its launch by NASA in July of 1999. Now starting the
  second decade of science the Chandra operations team has been using Python to
  create predictive thermal models of key spacecraft components. These models
  are being used in the mission planning and command load review process to
  ensure that the series of planned observations and attitudes for each week
  will maintain a safe thermal environment. Speaking from my perspective as a
  scientist working to create and calibrate the models, I will discuss the
  process and the key off-the-shelf tools that made it all possible. This
  includes fitting many-parameter models with the Sherpa package, parallel
  computation with mpi4py/MPICH2, large table manipulations with pytables/HDF5,
  and of course fast array math with NumPy.
