  As colonial birds, weaver birds nest in groups in very particular trees and
  face specific challenges in the selection and establishment of their nests.
  Socially-living individuals may organize themselves in particular
  configurations to decrease the probability of events that could be detrimental
  to their own fitness. This organization within a selected area could be
  dictated by biotic factors (such as predation, parasite invasion and/or
  thievery), or abiotic ones (like solar radiation, and protection from rain,
  among others), leading to a variety of arrangements. The parameters that
  individuals might evaluate while establishing/joining a colony help pick the
  main evolutionary drivers for colonial living. Here, the factors that
  determine the spatial relationships between the nests in a given tree are
  computationally modeled. We have built a computational model that explains the
  spatial arrangement of the nests with bird species, tree morphology, and the
  environment as factors.


  Python has been used significantly in the construction of the model,
  particularly the machine learning libraries and visualization toolkits. Python
  is used for the initial data processing, based on which, statistical analysis
  and visualization are done. We use the PCA and regression tree algorithms to
  build a model that describes the main factors affecting the spatial
  arrangement of the nests and classify the nests based on these factors.
  Visualization is used for determining key attributes in the tree morphology,
  and nest characteristics, that might be better predictors of overall nest
  distribution. This aids in guiding other modeling questions. NumPy arrays are
  used extensively, during the visualization. Mayavi2 is used for the 3-D
  visualization and matplotlib is used for the representation of the results of
  statistical analysis.
