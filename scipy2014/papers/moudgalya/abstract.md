  This article explains an approach to promote Information Technology (IT)
  literacy in India, which has evolved into a pyramid structure. We begin this
  article by explaining the design decisions, such as the use of FOSS and being
  a friendly interface between beginners and experts, in undertaking this
  activity.


  A Spoken Tutorial is a ten minute audio video tutorial on open source
  software, created to provide training on important IT topics. Spoken Tutorials
  are made suitable for self learning, through a novice check of the underlying
  script. The spoken part of these tutorials is dubbed in all Indian languages,
  to help children who are weak in English, while retaining employment
  potential. The effectiveness of conducting workshops using spoken tutorials is
  explained. A total of 400,000 students have been trained in the past three
  years through one or more Spoken Tutorial based Education and Learning through
  Free FOSS study (SELF) workshops.


  Students who undergo SELF workshops can create textbook companions, which
  contain code for the solved problems of given textbooks using a particular
  software. A Python Textbook Companion is a collection of Python code for a
  given textbook. These companions and the associated textbook, together, form a
  low cost document for Python in general, and the textbook, in particular. We
  have completed approximately 80 Python Textbook Companions and another 80 are
  in progress. From textbook companions, the students can progress to lab
  migration activity, the objective of which is to migrate labs based on
  proprietary software to FOSS. Interested students are trained to use FOSS
  systems in their projects and to contribute to the development of new FOSS
  systems. Using this approach and Python as a glue language, we have developed
  the following new FOSS systems: 1. Oscad, an electronic design automation
  tool, and a FOSS alternative to commercial software, such as ORCAD. 2. Sandhi,
  a block diagram based data acquisition for real time control, and a FOSS
  alternative to commercial software, such as LabVIEW.


  The pyramid structure explained in this work helps the beginners to become IT
  literate. Our design solutions are especially suitable to poor and
  marginalised sections of the society, which is at the bottom of the social
  pyramid. Our efforts to create and promote the worldâ€™s lowest cost computing
  system Aakash is briefly addressed in this work.
