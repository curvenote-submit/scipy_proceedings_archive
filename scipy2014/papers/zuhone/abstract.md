title: Simulating X-ray Observations with Python
description: X-ray astronomy is an important tool in the astrophysicist's
  toolkit to investigate high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Theoretical
  numerical simulations of astrophysical sources are fully three-dimensional
  representations of physical quantities such as density, temperature, and
  pressure, whereas astronomical observations are two-dimensional projections of
  the emission generated via mechanisms dependent on these quantities.
abstract: X-ray astronomy is an important tool in the astrophysicist's toolkit
  to investigate high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Theoretical numerical
  simulations of astrophysical sources are fully three-dimensional
  representations of physical quantities such as density, temperature, and
  pressure, whereas astronomical observations are two-dimensional projections of
  the emission generated via mechanisms dependent on these quantities. To bridge
  the gap between simulations and observations, algorithms for generating
  synthetic observations of simulated data have been developed. We present an
  implementation of such an algorithm in the yt analysis software package. We
  describe the underlying model for generating the X-ray photons, the important
  role that yt and other Python packages play in its implementation, and present
  a detailed workable example of the creation of simulated X-ray observations.
