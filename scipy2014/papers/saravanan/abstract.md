abstract: With laptops and tablets becoming more powerful and more ubiquitous in
  the classroom, traditional computer labs with rows of expensive desktop
  computers are slowly beginning to lose their relevance. An alternative
  approach for teaching Python is to use a browser-based virtual computer lab,
  with a notebook interface. The advantages of physical computer labs, such as
  face-to-face interaction, and the challenge of replicating them in a virtual
  environment are discussed. The need for collaborative features like
  terminal/notebook sharing and chatting is emphasized. A virtual computer lab
  is implemented using the GraphTerm server, with several experimental features
  including a virtual dashboard for monitoring tasks and progressively fillable
  notebooks for ensuring step-by-step completion of a sequence of tasks.
