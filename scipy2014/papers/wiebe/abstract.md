title: "Blaze: Building A Foundation for Array-Oriented Computing in Python"
description: We present the motivation and architecture of Blaze, a library for
  cross-backend data-oriented computation. Blaze provides a standard interface
  to connect users familiar with NumPy and Pandas to other data analytics
  libraries like SQLAlchemy and Spark.
abstract: We present the motivation and architecture of Blaze, a library for
  cross-backend data-oriented computation. Blaze provides a standard interface
  to connect users familiar with NumPy and Pandas to other data analytics
  libraries like SQLAlchemy and Spark. We motivate the use of these projects
  through Blaze and discuss the benefits of standard interfaces on top of an
  increasingly varied software ecosystem. We give an overview of the Blaze
  architecture and then demonstrate its use on a typical problem. We use the
  abstract nature of Blaze to quickly benchmark and compare the performance of a
  variety of backends on a standard problem.
