abstract: We introduce the ValidiPy package for validated numerics in Python.
  This suite of tools, which includes interval arithmetic and automatic
  differentiation, enables rigorous and guaranteed results using floating-point
  arithmetic. We apply the ValidiPy package to two classic problems in dynamical
  systems, calculating periodic points of the logistic map, and simulating the
  dynamics of a chaotic billiard model.
