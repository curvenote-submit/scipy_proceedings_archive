title: "TracPy: Wrapping the Fortran Lagrangian trajectory model TRACMASS"
description: Numerical Lagrangian trajectory modeling is a natural method of
  investigating transport in a circulation system and understanding the physics
  on the wide range of length scales that are actually experienced by a drifter.
abstract: Numerical Lagrangian trajectory modeling is a natural method of
  investigating transport in a circulation system and understanding the physics
  on the wide range of length scales that are actually experienced by a drifter.
  A previously-developed tool, TRACMASS, written in Fortran, accomplishes this
  modeling with a clever algorithm that operates natively on the commonly used
  staggered Arakawa C grid. TracPy is a Python wrapper written to ease running
  batches of simulations. Some improvements in TracPy include updating to
  netCDF4-CLASSIC from netCDF3 for saving drifter trajectories, providing an
  iPython notebook as a usermanual for using the system, and adding unit tests
  for stable continued development.
