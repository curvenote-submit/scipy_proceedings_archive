title: Teaching numerical methods with IPython notebooks and inquiry-based learning
description: A course in numerical methods should teach both the mathematical
  theory of numerical analysis and the craft of implementing numerical
  algorithms. The IPython notebook provides a single medium in which
  mathematics, explanations, executable code, and visualizations can be
  combined, and with which the student can interact in order to learn both the
  theory and the craft of numerical methods.
abstract: A course in numerical methods should teach both the mathematical
  theory of numerical analysis and the craft of implementing numerical
  algorithms. The IPython notebook provides a single medium in which
  mathematics, explanations, executable code, and visualizations can be
  combined, and with which the student can interact in order to learn both the
  theory and the craft of numerical methods. The use of notebooks also lends
  itself naturally to inquiry-based learning methods. I discuss the motivation
  and practice of teaching a course based on the use of IPython notebooks and
  inquiry-based learning, including some specific practical aspects. The
  discussion is based on my experience teaching a Masters-level course in
  numerical analysis at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology
  (KAUST), but is intended to be useful for those who teach at other levels or
  in industry.
