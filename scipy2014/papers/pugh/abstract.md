title: Python for research and teaching economics
description: Together with theory and experimentation, computational modeling
  and simulation has become a “third pillar” of scientific inquiry. I am
  developing a curriculum for a three part, graduate level course on
  computational methods designed to increase the exposure of graduate students
  and researchers in the School of Economics at the University of Edinburgh to
  basic techniques used in computational modeling and simulation using the
  Python programming language.

  My course requires no prior knowledge or experience with computer programming
  or software development and all current and future course materials will be
  made freely available on-line via GitHub.
