title: Scaling Polygon Adjacency Algorithms to Big Data Geospatial Analysis
description: Adjacency and neighbor structures play an essential role in many
  spatial analytical tasks. The computation of adjacenecy structures is
  non-trivial and can form a significant processing bottleneck as the total
  number of observations increases.
abstract: Adjacency and neighbor structures play an essential role in many
  spatial analytical tasks. The computation of adjacenecy structures is
  non-trivial and can form a significant processing bottleneck as the total
  number of observations increases. We quantify the performance of synthetic and
  real world binary, first-order, adjacency algorithms and offer a solution that
  leverages Python's high performance containers. A comparison of this algorithm
  with a traditional spatial decomposition shows that the former outperforms the
  latter as a function of the geometric complexity, i.e the number of vertices
  and edges.
