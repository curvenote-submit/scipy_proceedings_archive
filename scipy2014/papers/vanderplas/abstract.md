abstract: This paper presents a brief, semi-technical comparison of the
  essential features of the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to statistical
  inference, with several illustrative examples implemented in Python. The
  differences between frequentism and Bayesianism fundamentally stem from
  differing definitions of probability, a philosophical divide which leads to
  distinct approaches to the solution of statistical problems as well as
  contrasting ways of asking and answering questions about unknown parameters.
  After an example-driven discussion of these differences, we briefly compare
  several leading Python statistical packages which implement frequentist
  inference using classical methods and Bayesian inference using Markov Chain
  Monte Carlo.
