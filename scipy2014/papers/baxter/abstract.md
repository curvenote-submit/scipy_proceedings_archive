title: Scientific Computing with SciPy for Undergraduate Physics Majors
description: The physics community is working to improve the undergraduate
  curriculum to include computer skills that graduates will need in the
  workforce. At Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, we have added
  computational tools to our Junior/Senior physics laboratory, PHYS421w Research
  Methods.
abstract: The physics community is working to improve the undergraduate
  curriculum to include computer skills that graduates will need in the
  workforce. At Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, we have added
  computational tools to our Junior/Senior physics laboratory, PHYS421w Research
  Methods. The course emphasizes Python software tools (SciPy) for data analysis
  rather than traditional programming. The course uses real experiments to
  motivate the mastery of these tools.
