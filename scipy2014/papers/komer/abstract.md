title: "Hyperopt-Sklearn: Automatic Hyperparameter Configuration for Scikit-Learn"
description: Hyperopt-sklearn is a new software project that provides automatic
  algorithm configuration of the Scikit-learn machine learning library.
  Following Auto-Weka, we take the view that the choice of classifier and even
  the choice of preprocessing module can be taken together to represent a single
  large hyperparameter optimization problem.
abstract: Hyperopt-sklearn is a new software project that provides automatic
  algorithm configuration of the Scikit-learn machine learning library.
  Following Auto-Weka, we take the view that the choice of classifier and even
  the choice of preprocessing module can be taken together to represent a single
  large hyperparameter optimization problem. We use Hyperopt to define a search
  space that encompasses many standard components (e.g. SVM, RF, KNN, PCA,
  TFIDF) and common patterns of composing them together. We demonstrate, using
  search algorithms in Hyperopt and standard benchmarking data sets (MNIST,
  20-Newsgroups, Convex Shapes), that searching this space is practical and
  effective. In particular, we improve on best-known scores for the model space
  for both MNIST and Convex Shapes.
