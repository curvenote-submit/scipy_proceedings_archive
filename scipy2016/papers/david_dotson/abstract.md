  In science the filesystem often serves as a de facto database, with
  directory trees being the zeroth-order scientific data structure. But it can
  be tedious and error prone to work directly with the filesystem to retrieve
  and store heterogeneous datasets. datreant makes working with directory
  structures and files Pythonic with Treants: specially marked directories with
  distinguishing characteristics that can be discovered, queried, and filtered.
  Treants can be manipulated individually and in aggregate, with mechanisms for
  granular access to the directories and files in their trees. Disparate
  datasets stored in any format (CSV, HDF5, NetCDF, Feather, etc.) scattered
  throughout a filesystem can thus be manipulated as meta-datasets of Treants.
  datreant is modular and extensible by design to allow specialized applications
  to be built on top of it, with `MDSynthesis as an example for working with
  molecular dynamics simulation data. http://datreant.org/
