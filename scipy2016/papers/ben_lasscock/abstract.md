title: Generalized earthquake classification
description: We characterize the source of an earthquake based on identifying
  the nodal lines of the radiation pattern it produces. These characteristics
  are the mode of failure of the rock (shear or tensile), the orientation of the
  fault plane and direction of slip.
abstract: We characterize the source of an earthquake based on identifying the
  nodal lines of the radiation pattern it produces. These characteristics are
  the mode of failure of the rock (shear or tensile), the orientation of the
  fault plane and direction of slip. We will also derive a correlation
  coefficient comparing the source mechanisms of different earthquakes. The
  problem is formulated in terms of a simple binary classification on the
  surface of the sphere. Our design goal was to derive an algorithm that would
  be both robust to misclassification of the observed data and suitable for
  online processing. We will then go on to derive a mapping which translates the
  learned solution for the separating hyper-plane back to the physics of the
  problem, that is, the probable source type and orientation. For
  reproducibility, we will demonstrate our algorithm using the example data
  provided with the HASH earthquake classification software, which is available
  online.
