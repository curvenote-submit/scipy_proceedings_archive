  volume = {51},
  abstract = {A method for measuring the temporal temperature and number density in a rapid compression machine (RCM) using quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy near 7.6 \ensuremath{\mu}m is developed and presented in this paper. The ratios of H2O absorption peaks at 1316.55 cm-1 and 1316.97 cm-1 are used for these measurements. In order to isolate the effects of chemical reactions, an inert mixture of argon with 2.87\% water vapor is used for the present investigation. The end of compression pressures and temperatures in the RCM measurements are PC=10, 15, and 20 bar in the range of TC=1000 to 1200 K. The measured temperature history is compared with that calculated based on the adiabatic core assumption and is found to be within \ensuremath{\pm}5 K. The measured temporal number density of H2O to an accuracy of 1\%, using the absolute absorption of the two rovibrational lines, show that the mixture is highly uniform in temperature. A six-pass, 5.08 cm Herriott cell is used to calibrate the line strengths in air and broadening in an Ar bath gas.},

  abstract = {Incomplete combustion processes can emit organic pollutants, metals, and fine particles. Combustion by-products represent global human and environmental health challenges that are relevant not only in heavily industrialized nations, but also in developing nations where up to 90\% of rural households rely on unprocessed biomass fuels for cooking, warmth, and light. These issues were addressed at the Seventh International Congress on Combustion By-Products, which convened 4-6 June 2001 in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. This congress included a diverse group of multidisciplinary researchers and practitioners who discussed recent developments and future goals in the control of combustion by-products and their effects of exposure on human and ecologic health. Participants recommended that interdisciplinary, coordinated research efforts should be focused to capitalize on the important potential synergisms between efforts to reduce the adverse human health effects linked to exposures to combustion by-products and broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save energy through efficiency. In this article we summarize the principal findings and recommendations for research focus and direction.},
