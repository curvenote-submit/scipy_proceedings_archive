title: MONTE Python for Deep Space Navigation
description: The Mission Analysis, Operations, and Navigation Toolkit
  Environment (MONTE) is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) signature
  astrodynamic computing platform. It was built to support JPL's deep space
  exploration program, and has been used to fly robotic spacecraft to Mars,
  Jupiter, Saturn, Ceres, and many solar system small bodies.
abstract: The Mission Analysis, Operations, and Navigation Toolkit Environment
  (MONTE) is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) signature astrodynamic
  computing platform. It was built to support JPL's deep space exploration
  program, and has been used to fly robotic spacecraft to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
  Ceres, and many solar system small bodies. At its core, MONTE consists of
  low-level astrodynamic libraries that are written in C++ and presented to the
  end user as an importable Python language module. These libraries form the
  basis on which Python-language applications are built for specific
  astrodynamic applications, such as trajectory design and optimization, orbit
  determination, flight path control, and more. The first half of this paper
  gives context to the MONTE project by outlining its history, the field of deep
  space navigation and where MONTE fits into the current Python landscape. The
  second half gives an overview of the main MONTE libraries and provides a
  narrative example of how it can be used for astrodynamic analysis. For
