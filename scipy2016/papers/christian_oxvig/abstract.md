abstract: Computational methods have become a prime branch of modern science.
  Unfortunately, retractions of papers in high-ranked journals due to erroneous
  computations as well as a general lack of reproducibility of results have led
  to a so-called credibility crisis. The answer from the scientific community
  has been an increased focus on implementing reproducible research in the
  computational sciences. Researchers and scientists have addressed this
  increasingly important problem by proposing best practices as well as making
  available tools for aiding in implementing them. We discuss and give an
  example of how to implement such best practices using scientific Python
  packages. Our focus is on how to store the relevant metadata along with the
  results of a computational experiment. We propose the use of JSON and the HDF5
  database and detail a reference implementation in the Magni Python package.
  Further, we discuss the focuses and purposes of the broad range of available
  tools for making scientific computations reproducible. We pinpoint the
  particular use cases that we believe are better solved by storing metadata
  along with results the same HDF5 database. Storing metadata along with results
  is important in implementing reproducible research and it is readily
  achievable using scientific Python packages.
