Tell Me Something I Don't Know: Analyzing OkCupid Profiles
----------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

In this paper, we present an analysis of 59,000 OkCupid user profiles that
examines online self-presentation by combining natural language processing
(NLP) with machine learning. We analyze word usage patterns by self-reported
sex and drug usage status. In doing so, we review standard NLP techniques,
cover several ways to represent text data, and explain topic modeling. We find
that individuals in particular demographic groups self-present in consistent
ways. Our results also suggest that users may unintentionally reveal
demographic attributes in their online profiles.

Introduction
------------

Online dating has become a common and acceptable way of finding mates. In the
United States, 41 percent of adults know someone who uses online dating, 29
percent know someone who has met a partner this way, and 59 percent believe
online dating is a good way to meet people [Pew16]_. In 2015, online dating
sites or mobile dating apps were used by 27 percent of 18-24 year olds, 22
percent of 25-34 year olds, 21 percent of 35-44 year olds, 13 percent of 45-54
year olds, and 12 percent of 55-64 year olds [Pew16]_. Relative to 2013, usage
across every age group, except 25-34 year olds, increased. Given the popularity
of online dating, the way that people self-present online has broad
implications for the relationships they pursue.

Previous studies suggest that the free-text portion of online dating profiles
is an important factor (after photographs) for assessing attractiveness
[Fio08]_. The principle of homophily posits that people tend to associate and
bond with individuals who are similar to themselves and that this strongly
structures social networks, most prominently by race and ethnicity [McP01]_.
Perhaps not surprisingly, research suggests that homophily extends to online
dating, with people seeking mates similar to themselves [Fio05]_. However, it
remains unclear whether people within particular demographic groups, such as
sex or ethnicity, self-present in similar ways when searching for a mate online.

In this paper, we analyze demographic trends in online self-presentation.
Specifically, we focus on whether people signal demographic characteristics
through the way they present themselves online. We extend previous natural
language processing analyses of online dating [Nag09]_ by using a much larger
sample [#]_ and by combining NLP with supervised and unsupervised machine
learning. We leverage multiple approaches including clustering and topic
modeling as well as feature selection and modeling strategies. By exploring the
relationships between free-text self-descriptions and demographics, we discover
that we can predict users' demographic makeup and also find some unexpected
insights into unintentional signaling of demographic characteristics.

.. [#] [Nag09]_'s uses a sample of 1,000 individuals.

Code and data for this work are available in our ``okcupid`` GitHub repository
[#]_. A Jupyter notebook with the analysis results is also available [#]_.

Data
----

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Profile information [#]_ was available for 59,946 OkCupid users that were
members as of 06/26/2012, lived within 25 miles of San Francisco, had been
active in the previous year, and had at least one photo in their profile
[Wet15]_. The data set contained free-text responses to 10 essay prompts as
well as the following user characteristics: age, body type, diet, drinking
status, drug usage status, education level, ethnicity, height, income, job type,
location, number of children, sexual orientation, attitude toward pets,
religion, sex, astrological sign, smoking status, number of language spoken,
and relationship status.

.. [#] https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid. Our original data source was
       Everett Wetchler's ``okcupid`` repository (https://github.com/everett-wetchler/okcupid).
       However, after commit ``0d62e62``, in which the data was "fully
       anonimized" to exclude essays, we switched to Kim's repository. Kim uses
       the original Wetchler data.

This public [#]_ data set was selected for its diverse set of essay prompts and
availability of detailed user characteristics, which enabled us to examine the
connection between online self-presentation and demographics. This data set has
previously been used to demonstrate the basics of text analysis as well as how
to fit a simple logistic regression model to predict sex using only height
[Kim15]_. The present study extends previous work by analyzing additional
features and by introducing novel analyses.

Preprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Line break characters, URLs, and HTML tags were removed from the essay text. Multiple
periods, dashes, and white spaces were replaced by single instances, and all text was converted to lowercase.
Essays were segmented, first into sentences and then into individual terms, using
spaCy's [Hon16]_ [#]_ default tokenizer, which is well suited for online
communication as it maintains emoticons as discrete tokens. This allowed us to
differentiate between the syntactic way that special characters are
traditionally used and the meaning that's conveyed when they are used in
particular combinations. Punctuation was removed *after* the text was tokenized
[#]_. Finally, users who wrote less than five words for a given essay were
removed from the analysis.

.. [#] We used version 0.101.0. GitHub, 10 May 2016.
       https://github.com/spacy-io/spaCy/releases/tag/0.101.0.

.. [#] Punctuation is needed for the sentence tokenizer and sentences are
       important for the part-of-speech tagging.       

In order to reduce the number of categories, we combined drug usage status
levels. Specifically, users who responded "sometimes" or "often" were grouped
into a "yes" category. Individuals who answered "never" were assigned to the
"no" group and we created an "unknown" category for users who did not answer.

Methods
-------

Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Machine learning tasks require numerical inputs. There are several ways to
represent text as numerical feature vectors. Features typically correspond to
distinct tokens or to sequences of adjacent tokens. A token is a series of
characters, such as a word, that is treated as a distinct unit [Bir10]_.

One way to represent a corpus, or collection of text documents, is as a matrix
of token counts. This weights terms by their absolute frequencies. Often,
highly-weighted terms, such as "a" or "the," are not informative, so token
counts are weighted using term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf).

Tf-idf is the product of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency.
The term frequency refers to the *relative* frequency of term :math:`t` in
document :math:`d`. The inverse document frequency is the log of the total
number of documents :math:`N` to the number of documents that contain term
:math:`t`.

Log-Odds-Ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One metric for comparing word usage across groups is to calculate the
log-odds-ratio. The odds for word :math:`w` in the usage of group :math:`g`
are defined as :math:`O_{iw} = \frac{f_{iw}}{(1 - f_{iw})}` where :math:`f_{iw}`
is the frequency count of word :math:`w` normalized by total count of words
used by group :math:`i`. If a word is used only by one group, its
log-odds-ratio is infinite. Therefore, a constant is added to each frequency
when calculating the odds. The log of the ratio of the adjusted odds between
groups can then be used to compare word usage across groups. 

Non-negative Matrix Factorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For document clustering, the document corpus is projected onto a
:math:`k`-dimensional semantic space, with each axis corresponding to a
particular topic and each document being represented as a linear combination of
those topics [Xu_03]_. Methods such as latent semantic indexing require the
derived latent semantic space to be orthogonal, so this class of methods does
not work well when corpus topics overlap, as is often the case. Conversely,
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) does not require the latent semantic
space to be orthogonal, and therefore is able to find directions for related or
overlapping topics.

NMF was applied to each essay of interest using scikit-learn [Ped11]_ [#]_,
which uses the coordinate descent solver. NMF utilizes document frequency
counts, so the tf-idf matrix for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams was calculated,
while limiting tokens to those appearing in at least 0.5 percent of the
documents. NMF was calculated with :math:`k` dimensions, which factorized the
tf-idf matrix into two matrices, :math:`W` and :math:`H`. The dimensions were
``n_samples x k`` and ``k x n_features`` for :math:`W` and :math:`H`,
respectively. Group descriptions were given by top-ranked terms in the columns
of :math:`H`. Document membership weights were given by the rows of :math:`W`.
The maximum value in each row of :math:`W` determined essay group membership.

.. [#] We used version 0.17.1. GitHub, 18 Feb 2016.
       https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/releases/tag/0.17.1-1.
       This is particularly important for NMF as the coordinate descent solver
       is the default as of 0.17.0. Using the deprecated projected gradient
       solver will lead to different results.

Permutation Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permutation tests provide an exact sampling distribution of a test statistic
under the null hypothesis [Ger12]_ by computing the test statistic
for every manner by which labels can be associated with the observed data. In
practice, permutations are rarely ever completely enumerated. Instead, the
sampling distribution is approximated by randomly shuffling the labels :math:`P`
times.

The likelihood of the observed test statistic is determined as the proportion
of times that the absolute value of the permuted test statistics are greater
than or equal to the absolute value of the observed test statistic. This is the
:math:`p`-value for a two-tailed hypothesis. Permutation-based methods can be
used to compare two samples or to assess the performance of classifiers [Oja10]_.

There are several advantages to using randomization to make inferences as
opposed to parametric methods. Permutation tests do not assume normality, do
not require large samples, and "can be applied to all sorts of outcomes,
including counts, durations, or ranks" [Ger12]_.

Approach
--------

Our analyses focused on two demographic dimensions — sex and drug usage — and
on two essays — "My self summary" and "Favorite books, movies, shows, music,
food." These essays were selected because they were answered by most users.
"The most private thing I am willing to admit" prompt, for example, was ignored
by 32 percent of users.

We began by exploring the lexical features of the text as a way to determine
whether there were differences in writing styles by demographic group. We
considered essay length, the use of profanity and slang terms, and
part-of-speech usage. 

Essay length was determined based on the tokenized essays. A list of profane
words was obtained from the "Comprehensive Perl Archive Network" website. Slang
terms include words such as "dough," which refers to money, and acronyms like
"LOL." These terms come from the Wiktionary Category:Slang page [#]_. Note that
there is overlap between the profane and slang lists.

.. [#] https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Slang.

Each token in the corpus was associated with a lexical category using spaCy's
part-of-speech tagger. spaCy supports 19 coarse-grained tags [#]_ that expand
upon Petrov, Das, and McDonald's universal part-of-speech tagset [Pet11]_.

.. [#] https://spacy.io/docs#token-postags.

Differences in lexical features by demographic were analyzed using permutation
testing. We first compared average essay length by sex. Next, we examined
whether the proportion of females using profanity was different than the
proportion of males using such terms. The same was done for slang words.
Finally, we compared the average proportion of adjectives, nouns, and verbs and
identified the most distinctive terms in each lexical category by sex using the
smoothed log-odds-ratio, which accounts for variance.

We also analyzed text semantics by transforming the corpus into a tf-idf matrix
using spaCy's default tokenizer. We chose to include unigrams, bigrams, and
trigrams [#]_. Stop words [#]_ and terms that appeared in less than 0.5 percent
of documents were removed. Stemming, the process of removing word affixes, was
not performed. This resulted in a vocabulary size of 2,058 for the
self-summaries essay and 2,898 for the favorites essay.

.. [#] Unigrams are single tokens. Bigrams refer to two adjacent and trigrams
       to three adjacent tokens.

.. [#] Stop words are words that appear with very high frequency, such as "the"
       or "to."

Non-negative matrix factorization was used to identify latent structure in the
text. This structure represented "topics" or "clusters" which were described by
particular tokens. In order to determine whether particular demographic groups
were more likely to write about certain topics, the relative distribution of
users over topics was plotted. In cases where we were able to create
superordinate groupings from NMF topics — for example, by combining
semantically similar clusters — we used the log-odds-ratio to find their
distinctive tokens.

Based on our findings, we decided to fit a logistic regression model to predict
drug usage status.

Results
-------

In this section, we describe our lexical- and semantic-based findings.

We first compared lexical-based characteristics on the self-summary text by sex.
Our sample included 21,321 females and 31,637 males [#]_. On average, females
wrote significantly longer essays than males (150 terms compared to 139,
:math:`p` < 0.001).

.. [#] The difference between the number of users in the data set and the
       number of users in the analysis is due to the fact that we drop users
       that write less than five tokens for a particular essay.

Next, we compared the proportion of users who utilized profanity and slang.
Profanity was rarely used in the self-summary essay. Overall, only 6 percent of
users included profane terms in their self-descriptions. The difference by sex
was not statistically significant (5.8% of females versus 6.1% of males,
:math:`p` = 0.14).

Not surprisingly, slang was much more prevalent than profanity. 56 percent of
users used some form of slang in their self-summary essays and females used
slang at a significantly lower rate than males (54% versus 57%, :math:`p` <
0.001).

To compare part-of-speech usage, we first associated part-of-speech tags with
every token in the self-summary corpus. This resulted in counts by user and
part-of-speech. Each user's counts were then normalized by the user's essay
length to account for essay length differences between users. Of the 19
possible part-of-speech tags, we focused on adjectives, nouns, and verbs. The
proportions of part-of-speech terms used is shown in Table :ref:`pos-freq`. 

.. table:: Proportion of part-of-speech terms used, by sex. Asterisks (``**``)
           denote statistically significant differences at the 0.001 level.
           :label:`pos-freq`

   +-------------------+--------+--------+
   | Part-of-Speech    | Female | Male   |
   +===================+========+========+
   | Adjectives ``**`` | 10.61% | 10.16% |
   +-------------------+--------+--------+
   | Nouns ``**``      | 18.65% | 18.86% |
   +-------------------+--------+--------+
   | Verbs             | 18.28% | 18.27% |
   +-------------------+--------+--------+

Females used significantly more adjectives than males, while males used
significantly more nouns than females (:math:`p` < 0.001 for both). There was
no difference in verb usage between the sexes (:math:`p` = 0.91).

In addition to part-of-speech usage, we explored specific terms associated
with parts-of-speech that were distinctive to a particular sex. We did this
using the log-odds-ratio. Table :ref:`pos-terms` summarizes this, below.

   +----------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+

Distinctly-female adjectives are mostly descriptive. Males, on the other hand,
use more quantity-based and demonstrative adjectives. For nouns, females focus
on relationship- and experience-based terms while males write about work,
sports, and technology. (Note that ``m`` corresponds to the contracted form of
"am" when "Im" (no apostrophe) is tokenized and that ``'ll`` is the contracted
form of "will" in terms such as "I'll.")

NMF was then used to provide insight into the underlying topics that users
chose to use to describe themselves. Selecting the number of NMF components
(topics to which users are clustered) is an arbitrary and iterative process.
For the self-summary essay, we chose 25 components, which resulted in a diverse,
but manageable, set of topics.

Several expected themes emerged. Many users chose to highlight personality
traits, for example "humor" or "easy-going," while others focused on describing
the types of activities they enjoyed. Hiking, traveling, and cooking were
popular choices. Others chose to mention what kind of interaction they were
seeking, whether that was a long-term relationship, a friendship, or sex.
Topics and the highest weighted tokens for each are summarized in Table
:ref:`self-summary-topics`. Note that topic names were hand-labeled.

In order to determine whether there were differences in the topics that OkCupid
users chose to write about in their self-summaries, we plotted the distribution
over topics by demographic split. This allowed us to identify if specific
topics were distinct to particular demographic groups.

Figure :ref:`self-summary-sex` shows the distribution over topics by sex for the
self-summary essay. The highest proportion of users, of either sex, were in the
"about me" topic. This is not surprising given the essay prompt. For most
topics, females and males were mostly evenly distributed. For example, the
proportion of females who emphasized their careers or travel or other topics
was similar to the proportion of males who did the same. One exception was with
the "enthusiastic" topic, to which females belonged at almost twice the rate of
males. Users in this group used modifiers such as, "love," "really," and
"absolutely" regardless of the activities they were describing.

We further examined online self-presentation by considering the other available
essays in the OkCupid data set. Previous psychology research suggests that a
person's preferred music styles are tied to their personalities [Col15]_, and it
is possible that this extends to other media, such as books or movies. We next
analyzed the "Favorite books, movies, shows, music, food" essay.

As with the self-summaries, we removed users who wrote less than 5 tokens for
this essay (11,836 such cases). Note that because the favorites text is less
expository and more list-like, we did not perform a lexical-based analysis.
Instead, we used NMF to identify topics (or genres). Like with the
self-summaries, we chose 25 topics. Table :ref:`favorites-topics` lists the
topics and a selection of their highest weighted tokens.

The topics for this essay were less distinctive than the topics for the
self-summaries. In some cases, genres (or media) overlapped. For example, the
"TV-comedies-0" group included "The Walking Dead," which is a drama. There was
also overlap between groups. Still, we decided to keep 25 components. The
granularity these topics provided was used for further analyses. We created
superordinate groupings from the topics from which we extracted distinctive
tokens for particular demographic groups, showing the approach's flexibility.
Figure :ref:`favorites-sex` shows the distribution over topics, by sex.

.. figure:: favorites-sex.png

   Favorites distribution over topics, by sex :label:`favorites-sex`

The most popular topics, for both females and males, were "TV-hits" and
"music-rock," with about 16 percent of each sex writing about shows or artists
in those groups. We found more separation between the sexes in the favorites
essay than we did with the self-summaries. As with the self-summary essay, the enthusiastic group was
distinctly female. A distinctly male category included films such as "Fight
Club" and "The Shawshank Redemption" and musicians such as the Red Hot
Chili Peppers.

We created superordinate groupings by combining clusters. There were four
groups related to movies. In order to extract demographic-distinctive tokens,
we used the smoothed log-odds-ratio which accounts for variance as described by
Monroe, Colaresi, and Quinn [Mon09]_. The top movies for females were Harry
Potter, Pride & Prejudice, and Hunger Games while males favored Star Wars, The
Matrix, and Fight Club. The "movies-sci-fi" and "movies-drama-1" groups,
whose highest weighted tokens referred to the male-favored movies, had a higher
proportion of males than females. Similarly, the "teen" group, which
which corresponded to female-favored movies, had a higher proportion of females.
This reflects the terms found by the log-odds-ratio.

Figure :ref:`favorites-drugs` shows the distribution over topics by drug usage. In this
demographic category, users self-identified as drug users or non-drug users. To
this, we added a third level for users who declined the state their drug usage
status. There were 6,859 drug users, 29,402 non-drug users, and 11,849 users who did not state their drug usage status
("unknown").

.. figure:: favorites-drugs.png

   Favorites distribution over topics, by drug usage status :label:`favorites-drugs`

There was more intra-cluster variation in the distribution of users across topics than for the demographic split by sex.
Interestingly, the distribution across topics of users for whom we had no drug
usage information — those in the "unknown" category — tended to track the
distribution of self-identified drug users. In other words, the
proportion of drugs users and unknown users in most topics was similar.
This was especially true in cases where difference in proportions of drug users
and non-drug users was large. This unexpected finding may suggest that
individuals who did not respond to the drug usage question abstained in order
to avoid admitting they did use drugs.

Although we were unable to test this hypothesis directly due to lack of
the true drug-usage status for these users, the manner by which free-text
writing styles may unintentionally disclose demographic attributes is an
intriguing avenue for research. We used a predictive modeling approach to
attempt to gain insights into this question. Specifically, we trained a logistic
regression model on a binary outcome, using only drug users and non-drug users.
We used tf-idf weights on unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams as in the previous
analyses. We also balanced the classes by randomly sampling 6,859 accounts
from the non-drug user population. The data was split into training (80%) and
test (20%) sets in order to assess model accuracy. We then predicted class
labels on the group of unknown drug usage status.

Our initial model, which used only the "Favorites" essay text, accurately predicted
68.0 percent of drug users. When applied to the unknown users upon which the model was not trained,
the model predicted that 55 percent of the unknown users
were drug users and that 45 percent were not. When we examined the proportion
of predicted user by NMF cluster, however, we found intriguing patterns. In the
"music-rock" group — the group with the largest disparity between users and
non-users — 84 percent of unknowns were classified as drug users. In contrast,
only 25 percent of the unknowns in the "TV-comedies-0" group were classified as
such. While this cluster included "The Big Lebowski," which is identified as a
"stoner film" [She13]_, it also features "The Big Bang Theory," "How I Met Your
Mother," "NCIS," "New Girl," and "Seinfeld," which we would argue are decidedly
not drug-related.

These results prompted us examine if we could predict drug usage status
based on text alone. For this, we combined the text of all 10 essays and
dropped the 2,496 users who used less than five tokens in the full-text. As
before, we randomly sampled from the non-users in order to balance the classes
and split the data into training and test sets.

The full-text model accuracy increased to 72.7 percent. We used the feature
weights to find the 25 most-predictive drug-usage terms. These are listed below,
with the odds ratio [#]_ shown in parentheses.

.. [#] Logistic regression coefficient estimates are given as log-odds-ratios.
       The odds-ratios, which say how much a one unit increase affects the odds
       of being a drug user, are calculated by exponentiating.

more than non-users and also use particular profane terms.

Conclusion and Future Work
--------------------------

The current study extended previous NLP analyses of online dating profiles. The
scope of this work was larger than previous studies, both because of the size
of the data set and because of the novel combination of NLP with both
supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as logistic
regression and NMF. To our knowledge, there is currently no study that combines
these techniques to identify unintentional cues in online self-presentation or
uses them to predict demographics from free-text self descriptions. The idea
that people may unintentionally be providing information about themselves in
the way that they answer questions online is an intriguing avenue for future
research and can also be extended to deception online.

This work serves as an initial exploration for analyzing self-presentation in
the context of online dating. Given the availability of other demographic
characteristics, such as ethnicity and education level, future work will focus
on describing the ways in which other demographic groups tend to describe
themselves. We would also like to explore recent advancements in language
modeling techniques, such as word embeddings. Most importantly, future work
will involve exploring methods to help us better identify deception. If the
data ever becomes available, we would like to explore how the *way* that
people choose to self-present affects the interactions they have.
