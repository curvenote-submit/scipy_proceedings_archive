abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of 59,000 OkCupid user profiles
  that examines online self-presentation by combining natural language
  processing (NLP) with machine learning. We analyze word usage patterns by
  self-reported sex and drug usage status. In doing so, we review standard NLP
  techniques, cover several ways to represent text data, and explain topic
  modeling. We find that individuals in particular demographic groups
  self-present in consistent ways. Our results also suggest that users may
  unintentionally reveal demographic attributes in their online profiles.
