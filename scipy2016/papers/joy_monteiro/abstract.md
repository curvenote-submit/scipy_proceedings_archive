abstract: The Climate Modelling Toolkit (CliMT) is a Python-based software
  component toolkit providing a flexible problem-solving environment for climate
  science problems. It aims to simplify the development of models of complexity
  'appropriate' to the scientific question at hand. This aim is achieved by
  providing Python-level access to components commonly used in climate models
  (such as radiative transfer models and dynamical cores) and using the
  expressive data structures available in Python to access and combine these
  components. This paper describes the motivation behind developing CliMT, and
  serves as an introduction to interested users and developers.
