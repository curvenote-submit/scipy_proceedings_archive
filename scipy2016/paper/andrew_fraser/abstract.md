title: Functional Uncertainty Constrained by Law and Experiment
description: Many physical processes are modeled by unspecified functions. Here,
  we introduce the F_UNCLE project which uses the Python ecosystem of
  scientific software to develop and explore techniques for estimating such
  unknown functions and our uncertainty about them.
abstract: Many physical processes are modeled by unspecified functions. Here, we
  introduce the F_UNCLE project which uses the Python ecosystem of scientific
  software to develop and explore techniques for estimating such unknown
  functions and our uncertainty about them. The work provides ideas for
  quantifying uncertainty about functions given the constraints of both laws
  governing the function's behavior and experimental data. We present an
  analysis of pressure as a function of volume for the gases produced by
  detonating an imaginary explosive, estimating a best pressure function and
  using estimates of Fisher information to quantify how well a collection of
  experiments constrains uncertainty about the function. A need to model
  particular physical processes has driven our work on the project, and we
  conclude with a plot from such a process.
