  We approach the problem of software assurance in a novel way inspired
  by an analytic framework used in natural hazard risk mitigation. Existing
  approaches to software assurance focus on evaluating individual software
  projects in isolation. We demonstrate a technique that evaluates an entire
  ecosystem of software projects, taking into account the dependencey structure
  between packages. Our model analytically separates vulnerability and exposure
  as elements of software risk, then makes minimal assumptions about the
  propagation of these values through a software supply chain.

  Combined with
  data collected from package management systems, our model indicates
  "hot spots" in the ecosystem of higher expected
  risk. We demonstrate this model using data collected from the Python Package
  Index (PyPI). Our results suggest that Zope and Plone related projects carry
  the highest risk of all PyPI packages because they are widely used and their
  core libraries are no longer maintained.s
