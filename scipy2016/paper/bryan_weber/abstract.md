  The ignition delay of a fuel/air mixture is an important quantity in
  designing combustion devices, and these data are also used to validate
  computational kinetic models for combustion. One of the typical experimental
  devices used to measure the ignition delay is called a Rapid Compression
  Machine (RCM).

  This paper presents UConnRCMPy, an open-source Python package
  to process experimental data from the RCM at the University of Connecticut.
  Given an experimental measurement, UConnRCMPy computes the thermodynamic
  conditions in the reaction chamber of the RCM during an experiment along with
  the ignition delay. UConnRCMPy relies on several packages from the SciPy stack
  and the broader scientific Python community. UConnRCMPy implements an
  extensible framework, so that alternative experimental data formats can be
  incorporated easily. In this way, UConnRCMPy improves the consistency of RCM
  data processing and enables reproducible analysis of the data.
