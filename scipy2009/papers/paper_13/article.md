title: Neutron-scattering data acquisition and experiment automation with Python
abstract: >-
  PyDas is a set of Python modules that are used to integrate various components of the Data Acquisition System at Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). PyDas enables customized automation of neutron scattering experiments in a rapid and flexible manner. It provides wxPython-based GUIs for routine experiments as well as IPython command line scripting environment.
  Matplotlib and NumPy are used for data presentation and simple analysis.
  PyDas is currently used on a number of SNS instruments and plans exist to deploy it on new ones as they come on-line.
