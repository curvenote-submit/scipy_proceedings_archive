  title: 'Convert-XY: type-safe interchange of C++ and Python containers for NumPy extensions'
  description: >-
    We present Convert-XY: a new, header-only template library for converting containers between C++ and Python with a simple, succinct syntax. At compile-time, template-based recursive pattern matching is performed on the static structure of the C++ type to build dynamic type checkers and conversion functions.
