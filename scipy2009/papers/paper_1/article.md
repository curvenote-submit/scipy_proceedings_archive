title: Cython tutorial
abstract: |
  Cython is a programming language based on Python with extra
  syntax to provide static type declarations. This takes advantage
  of the benefits of Python while allowing one to achieve the
  speed of C. In this paper we describe the Cython language and
  show how it can be used both to write optimized code and to
  interface with external C libraries.
