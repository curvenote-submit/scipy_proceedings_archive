title: PMI - Parallel Method Invocation
abstract: |
  The Python module `pmi` (Parallel Method Invocation) is
  presented. It allows users to write simple, non-parallel Python scripts that use functions and classes that are executed in parallel.
  The module is well suited to be employed by other modules and packages that want to provide functions that are executed in parallel. The user of such a module does not have to write a parallel script, but can still profit from parallel execution.
