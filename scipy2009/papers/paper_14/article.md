title: 'Progress Report: NumPy and SciPy Documentation in 2009'
abstract: |
  In the Spring of 2008, the SciPy Documentation Project began to write
  documentation for NumPy and SciPy.  Starting from 8658 words, the
  NumPy reference pages now have over 110,000 words, producing an
  884-page PDF document.  These pages need to undergo both presentation
  and technical review.  Our plans include SciPy documentation as well
  as several user guides, tutorials, and pamphlets.  A critical need at
  this point is a stable funding stream to support the Documentation
  Coordinators who have been instrumental to the success of this
  project.
