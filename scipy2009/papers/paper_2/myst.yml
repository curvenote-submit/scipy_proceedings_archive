  title: Fast numerical computations with Cython
  description: We discuss Cython's features for fast NumPy array access in detail through examples and benchmarks. Using Cython to call natively compiled scientific libraries as well as using Cython in parallel computations is also given consideration. We conclude with a note on possible directions for future Cython development.
