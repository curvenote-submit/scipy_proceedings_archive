title: Fast numerical computations with Cython
abstract: |
  Cython has recently gained popularity as a tool for conveniently
  performing numerical computations in the Python
  environment, as well as mixing efficient calls to natively compiled libraries with Python
  code. We discuss Cython's features for fast NumPy array access in detail through examples and
  benchmarks. Using Cython to call natively compiled scientific libraries as well as using
  Cython in parallel computations is also given
  consideration. We conclude with a note on possible directions for
  future Cython development.
