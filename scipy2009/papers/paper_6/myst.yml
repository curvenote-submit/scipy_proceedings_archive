  title: 'PaPy: Parallel and distributed data-processing pipelines in Python'
  description: >-
    PaPy, which stands for parallel pipelines in Python, is a highly flexible
    framework that enables the construction of robust, scalable workflows for
    either generating or processing voluminous datasets. The simplicity and flexibility of
    distributed workflows using PaPy bridges the gap between desktop -> grid,
    enabling this new computing paradigm to be leveraged in the processing of large
    scientific datasets.
