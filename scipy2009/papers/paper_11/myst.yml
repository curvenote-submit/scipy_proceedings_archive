  title: 'Nitime: time-series analysis for neuroimaging data'
  description: |
    Nitime is a library for the analysis of time-series developed as part of the
    Nipy project, an effort to build open-source libraries for neuroimaging
    research. We briefly describe functional neuroimaging and some of the unique
    considerations applicable to time-series analysis of data acquired using these
    techniques, and provide examples of using nitime to analyze both synthetic data
    and real-world neuroimaging time-series.
