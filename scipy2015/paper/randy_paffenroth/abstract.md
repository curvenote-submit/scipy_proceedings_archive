title: Python in Data Science Research and Education
description: In this paper we demonstrate how Python can be used throughout the
  entire life cycle of a graduate program in Data Science. In interdisciplinary
  fields, such as Data Science, the students often come from a variety of
  different backgrounds where, for example, some students may have strong
  mathematical training but less experience in programming.
abstract: In this paper we demonstrate how Python can be used throughout the
  entire life cycle of a graduate program in Data Science. In interdisciplinary
  fields, such as Data Science, the students often come from a variety of
  different backgrounds where, for example, some students may have strong
  mathematical training but less experience in programming. Python’s ease of
  use, open source license, and access to a vast array of libraries make it
  particularly suited for such students. In particular, we will discuss how
  Python, IPython notebooks, scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, and pandas can be used
  in several phases of graduate Data Science education, starting from
  introductory classes (covering topics such as data gathering, data cleaning,
  statistics, regression, classification, machine learning, etc.) and
  culminating in degree capstone research projects using more advanced ideas
  such as convex optimization, non-linear dimension reduction, and compressed
  sensing. One particular item of note is the scikit-learn library, which
  provides numerous routines for machine learning. Having access to such a
  library allows interesting problems to be addressed early in the educational
  process and the experience gained with such “black box” routines provides a
  firm foundation for the students own software development, analysis, and
  research later in their academic experience.
