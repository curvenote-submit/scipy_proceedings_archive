abstract: This paper describes a tool for astronomical research implemented as
  an IPython notebook with a widget interface. The notebook uses Astropy, a
  community-developed package of fundamental tools for astronomy, and Astropy
  affiliated packages, as the back end. The widget interface makes Astropy a
  much more useful tool to undergraduates or other non-experts doing research in
  astronomy, filling a niche for software that connects beginners to
  research-grade code.
