title: "TrendVis: an Elegant Interface for dense, sparkline-like, quantitative
  visualizations of multiple series using matplotlib"
description: TrendVis is a plotting package that uses matplotlib to create
  information-dense, sparkline-like, quantitative visualizations of multiple
  disparate data sets in a common plot area against a common variable.
abstract: TrendVis is a plotting package that uses matplotlib to create
  information-dense, sparkline-like, quantitative visualizations of multiple
  disparate data sets in a common plot area against a common variable. This plot
  type is particularly well-suited for time-series data. We discuss the
  rationale behind and the challenges associated with adapting matplotlib to
  this particular plot style, the TrendVis API and architecture, and various
  features available for users to customize and enhance the readability of their
  figures while walking through a sample workflow.
