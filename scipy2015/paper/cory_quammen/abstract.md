abstract: VTK and ParaView are leading software packages for data analysis and
  visualization. Since their early years, Python has played an important role in
  each package. In many use cases, VTK and ParaView serve as modules used by
  Python applications. In other use cases, Python modules are used to generate
  visualization components within VTK. In this paper, we provide an overview of
  Python integration in VTK and ParaView and give some concrete examples of
  usage. We also provide a roadmap for additional Python integration in VTK and
  ParaView in the future.
