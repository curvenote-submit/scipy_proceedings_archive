title: "PyEDA: Data Structures and Algorithms for Electronic Design Automation"
description: This paper introduces PyEDA, a Python library for electronic design
  automation (EDA). PyEDA provides both a high level interface to the
  representation of Boolean functions, and blazingly-fast C extensions for
  fundamental algorithms where performance is essential.
abstract: This paper introduces PyEDA, a Python library for electronic design
  automation (EDA). PyEDA provides both a high level interface to the
  representation of Boolean functions, and blazingly-fast C extensions for
  fundamental algorithms where performance is essential. PyEDA is a hobby
  project which has the simple but audacious goal of improving the state of
  digital design by using Python.
