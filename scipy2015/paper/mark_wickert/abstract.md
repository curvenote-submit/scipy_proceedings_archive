abstract: This paper will take the audience through the story of how an
  electrical and computer engineering faculty member has come to embrace Python,
  in particular IPython Notebook (IPython kernel for Jupyter), as an analysis
  and simulation tool for both teaching and research in signal processing and
  communications. Legacy tools such as MATLAB are well established (entrenched)
  in this discipline, but engineers need to be aware of alternatives, especially
  in the case of Python where there is such a vibrant community of developers.
  In this paper case studies will also be used to describe domain specific code
  modules that are being developed to support both lecture and lab oriented
  courses going through the conversion from MATLAB to Python. These modules in
  particular augment scipy.signal in a very positive way and enable rapid
  prototyping of communications and signal processing algorithms. Both student
  and industry team members in subcontract work, have responded favorably to the
  use of Python as an engineering problem solving platform. In teaching, IPython
  notebooks are used to augment lecture material with live calculations and
  simulations. These same notebooks are then placed on the course Web Site so
  students can download and tinker on their own. This activity also encourages
  learning more about the language core and Numpy, relative to MATLAB. The
  students quickly mature and are able to turn in homework solutions and
  complete computer simulation projects, all in the notebook. Rendering
  notebooks to PDF via LaTeX is also quite popular. The next step is to get
  other signals and systems faculty involved.
