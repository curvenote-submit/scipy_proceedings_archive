title: Creating a Real-Time Recommendation Engine using Modified K-Means
  Clustering and Remote Sensing Signature Matching Algorithms
description: Built on Google App Engine (GAE), RealMassive encountered
  challenges while attempting to scale its recommendation engine to match its
  nationwide, multi-market expansion. To address this problem, we borrowed a
  conceptual model from spectral data processing to transform our
  domain-specific problem into one that the GAE's search engine could solve.

  while attempting to scale its recommendation engine to match its nationwide,
  multi-market expansion. To address this problem, we borrowed a conceptual
  model from spectral data processing to transform our domain-specific problem
  into one that the GAE's search engine could solve. Rather than using a more
  traditional heuristics-based relevancy ranking, we filtered and scored results
  using a modified version of a spectral angle. While this approach seems to
  have little in common with providing a recommendation based on similarity,
  there are important parallels: filtering to reduce the search space;
  independent variables that can be resampled into a signature; a signature
  library to identify meaningful similarities; and an algorithm that lends
  itself to an accurate but flexible definition of similarity. We implemented
  this as a web service that provides recommendations in sub-second time. The
  RealMassive platform currently covers over 4.5 billion square feet of
  commercial real estate inventory and is expanding quickly."
