title: "HoloViews: Building Complex Visualizations Easily for Reproducible Science"
description: Scientific visualization typically requires large amounts of custom
  coding that obscures the underlying principles of the work and makes it
  difficult to reproduce the results. Here we describe how the new HoloViews
  Python package, when combined with the IPython Notebook and a plotting
  library, provides a rich, interactive interface for flexible and nearly
  code-free visualization of your results while storing a full record of the
  process for later reproduction.

  Scientific visualization typically requires large amounts of custom coding
  that obscures the underlying principles of the work and makes it difficult to
  reproduce the results. Here we describe how the new HoloViews Python package,
  when combined with the IPython Notebook and a plotting library, provides a
  rich, interactive interface for flexible and nearly code-free visualization of
  your results while storing a full record of the process for later
  reproduction.


  HoloViews provides a set of general-purpose data structures that allow you to
  pair your data with a small amount of metadata. These data structures are then
  used by a separate plotting system to render your data interactively, e.g.
  within the IPython Notebook environment, revealing even complex data in
  publication-quality form without requiring custom plotting code for each
  figure.


  HoloViews also provides powerful containers that allow you to organize this
  data for analysis, embedding it whatever multidimensional continuous or
  discrete space best characterizes it. The resulting workflow allows you to
  focus on exploring, analyzing, and understanding your data and results, while
  leading directly to an exportable recipe for reproducible research.
