title: Automated Image Quality Monitoring with IQMon
description: Automated telescopes are capable of generating images more quickly
  than they can be inspected by a human, but detailed information on the
  performance of the telescope is valuable for monitoring and tuning of their
  operation.
abstract: Automated telescopes are capable of generating images more quickly
  than they can be inspected by a human, but detailed information on the
  performance of the telescope is valuable for monitoring and tuning of their
  operation. The IQMon (Image Quality Monitor) package1 was developed to provide
  basic image quality metrics of automated telescopes in near real time.
