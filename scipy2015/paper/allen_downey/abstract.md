abstract: |
  Using data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), we
  investigate marriage patterns among women in the United States We describe and
  predict age at first marriage for successive generations based on decade of
  birth. The fraction of women married by age 22 has dropped by 11 percentage
  points per decade, from 69\% for women born in the 1940s to 13\% for women
  born in the 90s. The fraction of women married by age 42 fell more slowly,
  from 93\% for women born in the 40s to 82\% for women born in the 70s.
  Projections suggest that this fraction will be substantially lower for later
  generations, between 68\% and 72\%. Along with these results, this paper
  presents an introduction to survival analysis methods and an implementation in
  Python.
