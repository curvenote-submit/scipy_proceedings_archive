  Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) is a technique of compactly representing
  a joint distribution by exploiting dependencies between the random variables.
  It also allows us to do inference on joint distributions in a computationally
  cheaper way than the traditional methods. PGMs are widely used in the field of
  speech recognition, information extraction, image segmentation, modelling gene
  regulatory networks.


  `pgmpy` is a python library for working with graphical models. It allows
  the user to create their own graphical models and answer inference or map
  queries over them. `pgmpy` has implementation of many inference algorithms like
  VariableElimination, Belief Propagation etc.


  This paper first gives a short introduction to PGMs and various other python
  packages available for working with PGMs. Then we discuss about creating and
  doing inference over Bayesian Networks and Markov Networks using `pgmpy`.
