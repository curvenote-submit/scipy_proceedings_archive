  Hydrological terrain analysis is important for applications such as
  environmental resource, agriculture, and flood risk management. It is based on
  processing of high-resolution, tiled digital elevation model (DEM) data for
  geographic regions of interest. A major challenge in global hydrological
  terrain analysis is addressing cross-tile dependencies that arise from the
  tiled nature of the underlying DEM data, which is too large to hold in memory
  as a single array. We are not aware of existing tools that can accurately and
  efficiently perform global terrain analysis within current memory and
  computational constraints. We solved this problem by implementing a new
  algorithm in Python, which uses a simple but robust file-based locking
  mechanism to coordinate the work flow between an arbitrary number of
  independent processes operating on separate DEM tiles.


  We used this system to analyze the conterminous USâ€™s terrain at 1 arc-second
  resolution in under 3 days on a single compute node, and global terrain at 3
  arc-second resolution in under 4 days. Our solution is implemented and made
  available as pyDEM, an open source Python/Cython library that enables global
  geospatial terrain analysis. We will describe our algorithm for calculating
  various terrain analysis parameters of interest, our file-based locking
  mechanism to coordinate the work between processors, and optimization using
  Cython. We will demonstrate pyDEM on a few example test cases, as well as real
  DEM data.
