The humble mathematical [relation](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/fcns.htm), a fundamental (if implicit)
component in computational algorithms, is conspicuously absent
in most standard container collections, including Python’s. In
this paper, we present the basics of a relation container, and
why you might use it instead of other methods. The concept
is simple to implement and easy to use. We will walk through
with code examples using our implementation of a relation
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/relate)
