abstract: This article presents an open-source Python software package, dubbed
  RTGraph, to visualize, process and record physiological signals
  (electrocardiography, electromyography, etc.) in real-time. RTGraph has a
  multiprocess architecture. This allows RTGraph to take advantage of multiple
  cores and to be able to handle data rates typically encountered during the
  acquisition and processing of biomedical signals. It also allows RTGraph to
  have a clean separation between the communication and visualization code. The
  paper presents the architecture and some programming details of RTGraph. It
  also includes three examples where RTGraph was adapted to work with (i)
  signals from a Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in the context of a
  biomechanical experiment; (ii) electromyography signals to estimate muscle
  fatigue; and (iii) pressure signals from a device used to monitor nutrition
  disorders in premature infants.
