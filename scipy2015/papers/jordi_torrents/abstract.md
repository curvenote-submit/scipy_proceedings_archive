title: "Structural Cohesion: Visualization and Heuristics for Fast Computation
  with NetworkX and matplotlib"
description: The structural cohesion model is a powerful sociological conception
  of cohesion in social groups, but its diffusion in empirical literature has
  been hampered by computational problems. We present useful heuristics for
  computing structural cohesion that allow a speed-up of one order of magnitude
  over the algorithms currently available.
abstract: The structural cohesion model is a powerful sociological conception of
  cohesion in social groups, but its diffusion in empirical literature has been
  hampered by computational problems. We present useful heuristics for computing
  structural cohesion that allow a speed-up of one order of magnitude over the
  algorithms currently available. Both the heuristics and the exact algorithm
  have been implemented on NetworkX by the first author. Using as examples three
  large collaboration networks (co-maintenance of Debian packages, co-authorship
  in Nuclear Theory, and co-authorship in High-Energy Theory) we illustrate our
  approach to measure structural cohesion in relatively large networks. We also
  introduce a novel graphical representation of the structural cohesion analysis
  to quickly spot differences across networks. It is implemented using
  matplotlib.
