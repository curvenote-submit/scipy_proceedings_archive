abstract: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Air
  Resources Laboratory's HYSPLIT (HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Transport)
  model Drax98, Drax97 uses a hybrid Langrangian and Eulerian calculation method
  to compute air parcel trajectories and particle dispersion and deposition
  simulations. Air parcels are hypothetical small volumes of air with uniform
  characteristics. The HYSPLIT model outputs air parcel paths projected forwards
  or backwards in time (trajectories) and is used in a variety of scientific
  contexts. Here we present the first package in the mainstream scientific
  Python ecosystem designed to facilitate HYSPLIT trajectory analysis workflow
  by providing an intuitive API for generating, inspecting, and plotting
  trajectory paths and data.
