title: "PyRK: A Python Package For Nuclear Reactor Kinetics"
description: In this work, a new python package, PyRK (Python for Reactor
  Kinetics), is introduced. PyRK has been designed to simulate, in zero
  dimensions, the transient, coupled, thermal-hydraulics and neutronics of
  time-dependent behavior in nuclear reactors.
abstract: In this work, a new python package, PyRK (Python for Reactor
  Kinetics), is introduced. PyRK has been designed to simulate, in zero
  dimensions, the transient, coupled, thermal-hydraulics and neutronics of
  time-dependent behavior in nuclear reactors. PyRK is intended for analysis of
  many commonly studied transient scenarios including normal reactor startup and
  shutdown as well as abnormal scenarios including Beyond Design Basis Events
  (BDBEs) such as Accident Transients Without Scram (ATWS). For robustness, this
  package employs various tools within the scientific python ecosystem. For
  additional ease of use, it employs a reactor-agnostic, object-oriented data
  model, allowing nuclear engineers to rapidly prototype nuclear reactor control
  and safety systems in the context of their novel nuclear reactor designs.
