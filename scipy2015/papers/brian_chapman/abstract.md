title: Python as a First Programming Language for Biomedical Scientists
description: "We have been involved with teaching Python to biomedical
  scientists since 2005. In all, seven courses have been taught: 5 at the
  University of Pittsburgh, as a required course for biomedical informatics
  graduate students."
abstract: "We have been involved with teaching Python to biomedical scientists
  since 2005. In all, seven courses have been taught: 5 at the University of
  Pittsburgh, as a required course for biomedical informatics graduate students.
  Students have primarily been biomedical informatics graduate students with
  other students coming from human genetics, molecular biology, statistics, and
  similar fields. The range of prior computing experience has been wide: the
  majority of students had little or no prior programming experiences while a
  few students were experienced in other languages such as C/C++ and wanted to
  learn a scripting language for increased productivity. The semester-long
  courses have followed a procedural first approach then an introduction to
  object-oriented programming. By the end of the course students produce an
  independent programming project on a topic of their own choosing."
