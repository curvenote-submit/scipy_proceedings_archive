title: "Dask: Parallel Computation with Blocked algorithms and Task Scheduling"
description: Dask enables parallel and out-of-core computation. We couple
  blocked algorithms with dynamic and memory aware task scheduling to achieve a
  parallel and out-of-core NumPy clone. We show how this extends the effective
  scale of modern hardware to larger datasets and discuss how these ideas can be
  more broadly applied to other parallel collections.
