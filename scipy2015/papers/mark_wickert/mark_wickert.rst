Signal Processing and Communications: Teaching and Research Using IPython Notebook
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   This paper will take the audience through the story of how an electrical and computer
   engineering faculty member has come to embrace Python, in particular IPython Notebook
   (IPython kernel for Jupyter),
   as an analysis and simulation tool for both teaching and research in signal processing
   and communications. Legacy tools such as MATLAB are well established (entrenched) in
   this discipline, but engineers need to be aware of alternatives, especially in the case
   of Python where there is such a vibrant community of developers.
   In this paper case studies will also be used to describe domain
   specific code modules that are being developed to support both lecture and lab oriented
   courses going through the conversion from MATLAB to Python. These modules in particular
   augment ``scipy.signal`` in a very positive way and enable rapid prototyping of
   communications and signal processing algorithms. Both student and industry team
   members in subcontract work, have responded favorably to the use of Python as an
   engineering problem solving platform. In teaching, IPython notebooks are used to augment
   lecture material with live calculations and simulations. These same notebooks are then
   placed on the course Web Site so students can download and *tinker* on their own. This
   activity also encourages learning more about the language core and Numpy, relative to
   MATLAB. The students quickly mature and are able to turn in homework solutions and
   complete computer simulation projects, all in the notebook. Rendering notebooks to
   PDF via LaTeX is also quite popular. The next step is to get other signals and systems faculty
   involved.

Introduction
------------

This journey into Python for electrical engineering problem solving began with
the writing of the book *Signals and Systems for Dummies* [Wic2013]_, published summer
2013. This book features the use of Python (``Pylab``) to
bring life to the mathematics behind signals and systems theory.
Using Python in the Dummies book is done to make
it easy for all readers of the book to develop their signals and system problem solving skills, without additional
software tools investment.
Additionally, the provided custom code module ``ssd.py`` [ssd]_, which is built on
top of  ``numpy``,  ``matplotlib``, and ``scipy.signal``, makes it easy to work and extend the examples found in
the book. Engineers love to visualize their work with plots of various types. All of the plots in the book are
created using Python, specifically ``matplotlib``.

The next phase of the journey, focuses on the research and development
side of signals and systems work. During a recent sabbatical [#]_ Python and IPython notebook
(IPython kernel for Jupyter) served as the primary digital signal
processing modeling tools on three different projects. Initially it was not clear which tool would be best, but
following discussions with co-workers [#]_ Python seemed to be the right choice. Note, for the most part, the analysis
team was new to Python, all of us having spent many years using MATLAB/Octave [MATLAB]_/[Octave]_. A nice motivating
factor is that Python is already in the workflow in the real-time DSP platform used by the company.

.. [#] Academic year 2013-2014 was spent working for a small engineering firm, Cosmic AES.
.. [#] Also holding the Ph.D. and/or MS in Electrical Engineering, with emphasis in communications and signal processing.

The third and current phase of the Python
transformation began at the start of the 2014-2015 academic year. The move was made to push out Python to the
students, via the IPython Notebook, in five courses: digital signal processing, digital communications, analog
communications, statistical signal processing, and real-time signal processing. Four of the courses are traditional
lecture format, while the fifth is very hands-on lab oriented, involving embedded systems programming and hardware
interfacing. IPython Notebook works very well for writing lab reports, and easily allows theoretical and experimental
results to be integrated. A notebook interface is not a new concept in scientific computing tool sets [#]_. Both of
these tools are very powerful for specific problem classes.

.. [#] See for example *Mathematica* [Mathematica]_ (commercial) and *wxMaxima* [Maxima]_ (open source).

The remainder of this paper is organized into the following sections: arriving at Python for communications and signal
processing modeling, describing IPython notebook usage, case studies, and conclusions.

Arriving at Python for Communications and Signal Processing Modeling
--------------------------------------------------------------------

About three years ago while working on a study contract for a small business, I started investigating the use of
open-source alternatives over MATLAB. I initially homed in on using Octave [Octave]_ for its syntax compatibility
with MATLAB. Later I started to explore Python and became fascinated by the ease of use offered by the IPython (QT)
console and the high quality of ``matplotlib`` 2D plots. The full power of Python/IPython
for engineering and scientific computing gradually took hold as I learned more about the language and the
engineering problem capabilities offered by ``pylab``.

When I took on the assignment of writing the *Signals and Systems for Dummies* book [Wic2013]_ Python seemed like a
good choice because of the relative ease with which anyone could obtain the tools and then get hands-on experience with
the numerical examples I was writing into the book. The power of ``numpy`` and the algorithms available in ``scipy`` are
very useful in this discipline, but I immediately recognized that enhancements to ``scipy.signal`` are needed to make
signals
and systems tinkering user friendly. As examples were written for the book, I began to write support functions that
fill in some of the missing details not found in ``scipy``. This is the basis for the module ``ssd.py``, a constant work in
progress to make open source signals and systems software more accessible to the engineering community.

Modules Developed or Under Development
======================================

As already briefly mentioned, the first code module I developed is ``ssd.py`` [#]_. This module contains 61 functions
supporting *signal* generation, manipulation, and display, and *system* generation and characterization. Some of
the functions implement subsystems such as a ten band audio equalization filter or the model of an automobile cruise
control system. A pair of wrapper functions ``to_wav()`` and ``from_wav()`` make it easy for students to write and read 1D
``ndarrays`` from a wave file. Specialized plotting functions are present to make it easy to visualize both signals and
systems. The collection of functions provides general support for both continuous and discrete-time signals and systems, as
well as specific support for examples found in [Wic2013]_. Most all of functions are geared toward undergraduate education.
More modules have followed since then.

.. [#] ``http://www.eas.uccs.edu/wickert/SSD/docs/python/``

The second module developed, ``digitalcom.py``, focuses on the special needs of digital communications, both *modulation*
and *demodulation*. At present this module contains 32 functions. These functions are focused on waveform level simulation of
contemporary digital communication systems. When I say simulation I specifically mean *Monte Carlo* techniques which
involve the use of *random bit streams*,  noise, channel fading, and interference. Knowledge of
digital signal processing techniques plays a key role in implementation of these systems. The functions in this module
are a combination of communcation waveform generators and specialized signal processing building blocks, such as the
*upsampler* and *downsampler*, which allow the sampling rate of a signal to be raised or lowered, respectively.
More functions are under development for this module, particularly in the area of orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), the key modulation type found in the wireless telephony standard, long term evolution (LTE).

A third module, ``fec_conv.py``, implements a rate 1/2 *convolutional encoding* and *decoding* class [Zie2015]_.
In digital communications digital
information in the form of *bits* are sent from the transmitter to the receiver. The transmission channel might be
wired or wireless, and the signal carrying the bits may be at *baseband*, as in say Ethernet, or *bandpass* on a *carrier
frequency*, as in WiFi. To error protect bits sent over the channel *forward error correction* (FEC) coding, such as
*convolutional codes*, may be employed. Encoding is applied before the source bits are modulated onto the carrier to form
the transmitted signal. With a rate 1/2 convolutional code each source bit is encoded into two channel bits using a
*shift register* of length :math:`K` (termed *constraint length*) with *excusive or* logic gate connections.
The class allows arbitrary constraint length codes and allows *puncturing* and *depuncturing* patterns.
With pucturing/depuncturing certain code bits are *erased*, that is not sent, so as to increase the code rate from
1/2 to say 3/4 (4 channel bits for every three source bits).

For decoding the class implements the Viterbi algorithm (VA), which is a *dynamic programming* algorithm.
The most likely path the received signal takes through a *trellis structure* is how the VA recovers the sent bits [Zie2015]_.
Here the *cost* of traversing a particular trellis branch is established using  *soft decision metrics*,
where soft decision refers to how information in the *demodulated* radio signal is converted metric values.

The class contains seven methods that include two graphical
display functions, one of which shows the *survivor traceback paths* through the trellis back in time
by the decoder *decision depth*. The traceback paths, one for each of the :math:`2^{K-1}` trellis states, give
students insight into the operation of the VA.
Besides the class, ``fec_conv`` also contains four functions for computing error probability bounds using
the *weight structure* of the code under both *hard* and *soft* branch metric distance calculations [Zie2015]_.

A fourth module, ``synchronization.py``, was developed while teaching a *phase-locked loops* course, Summer 2014.
Synchronization is extremely important is all modern communications communications schemes.
Digital communication systems fail to get data bits through a wireless link when synchronization fails.
This module supplies eight simulation functions ranging from a basic phase-locked loop and both carrier and
symbol synchronization functions for digital communications waveforms. This module is also utilized in an analog
communications course taught Spring 2015.

Describing IPython Notebook Use Scenarios
-----------------------------------------

In this section I describe how Python, and in particular the IPython notebook, has been integrated into teaching,
graduate student research, and industry research and development.

Teaching
========

To put things into context, the present lecturing style for all courses I teach
involves the use of a tablet PC, a data projector, a microphone, and audio/video screen capture software.
Live Python demos are run in the notebook, and in many cases all the code is developed in
real-time as questions come from the class. The notebook is more than just a visual experience.
A case in point is the notebook audio control which adds sound playback capability. A 1D ``ndarray`` can be saved as a
*wave file* for playback. Simply put, signals do make sounds and the
action of systems changes what can be heard. Students enjoy hearing as well as seeing results.
By interfacing the tablet *lineout* or *headphone* output to the podium
interface to the classroom speakers, everyone can hear the impact of algorithm tweaks on what is being heard. This
is where the fun starts! The modules ``scipy.signal`` and ``ssd.py``, described earlier, are imported at the top
of each notebook.

For each new chapter of lecture material I present on the tablet PC,  a new IPython notebook is created to hold
corresponding numerical analysis and simulation demos. When appropriate, starter content is added to
the notebook before the lecture. For example I can provide relevant theory right in the notebook to transition
between the lecture notes mathematics and the notebook demos. Specifically,
text and mathematics are placed in *markdown cells*. The notebook theory is however very brief compared to that of the
course lecture notes. Preparing this content is easy, since the lecture notes are written in LaTeX I drop the
selected equations right into mark down cells will minimal rework. Sample calculations and simulations, with corresponding plots, are often generated
in advance, but the intent is to make parameter changes during the lecture, so the students can get a feel for how a
particular math model relates to real-word communications and signal processing systems.

Computer projects benefit greatly from the use of the notebook, as sample notebooks with starter code are easily
posted to the course Web Site. The sample notebook serves as a template for the project report document that the
student will ultimately turn in for grading. The ability to convert the notebook to a LaTeX PDF
document works for many students. Others used *screenshots* of selected notebook cells and pasted
them into a word processor document. In Spring 2015 semester students turned in printed copies of the notebook
and as backup, supplied also the notebook file. Marking on real paper documents is still my preference.

Graduate Student Research
=========================

In working with graduate students on their research, it is normal to exchange code developed by fellow graduate
students working on related problems. Background discussions,  code implementations of algorithms, and worked examples
form a perfect use case for IPython notebook.
The same approach holds for faculty interaction with their graduate students. In this scenario the
faculty member, who is typically short on free time, gains a powerful advantage in that more than one student may need
to brought up to speed on the same code base. Once the notebook is developed it is shared with one or more students and
often demoed in front the student(s) on a lab or office computer. The ability to include figures means that system block diagrams can also be
placed in the notebook.

As the student makes progress on a research task they document their work in a notebook. Faculty member(s) are briefed
on the math models and simulation results. Since the notebook is live, hypothetical questions can be quickly
tested and answered.

Industry Research and Development
=================================

With the notebook engineers working on the same team are able to share analytical models and  development approaches
using markdown cells. The inclusion of LaTeX markup is a welcome addition and furthers the establishment of
notational conventions, during the development of signal processing
algorithms.

Later, prototype algorithm development is started using code cells. Initially, computer  synthesized signals (waveforms)
are used to validated the core functionality of an algorithm. Next, signal captures (date files) from the actual real-time
hardware are used as a source of test vectors to verify that performance metrics are being achieved. Notebooks
can again be passed around to team members for further algorithm testing. Soon code cell functions can be moved to
code modules and the code modules distributed to team members via ``git`` [git]_ or some other distributed revision control
system. At every step of the way ``matplotlib`` [matpltlib]_ graphics are used to visualize performance of a particular
algorithm, versus say a performance bound.

Complete subsystem testing at the Python level is the final step for pure Python implementations. When Python is used to
construct a behavioral level model, then more testing will be required. In this second case the code is
moved to a production environment and recoding to say C/C++. It might also be that the original Python model is simply
an abstraction of real electronic hardware, in which case a hardware implementer uses the notebook (maybe just a PDF
version) to create a hardware prototype, e.g., a *field programable gate array* (FPGA) or custom integrated circuit.

Live From the Classroom
=======================

Here live from the classroom means responding to questions using on-the-fly IPython notebook demos. This is an excellent
way to show off the power of Python. Sometimes questions come and you feel like building a quick model right then and
there during a lecture. When successful, this hopefully locks in a solid understanding of the concepts involved for
the whole class. The fact that the lecture is being recorded means that students can recreate the same demo at their
leisure when they watch the lecture video. The notebook is also saved and posted as a supplement/companion to the lecture.
As mentioned earlier, there is a corresponding
notebook for each chapter of lecture material [#]_. I set the goal of re-posting the chapter notebooks each time a new
lecture video is posted. This way the students have something to play with as they work on the
current homework assignment.

Case Studies
------------

In this section I present case studies that present the details on one or more of the IPython notebook
use cases described in the previous section of this paper. Case studies from industry R&D are not included here due
to the propriety nature of the work.

In all of the case studies you see that graphical results are produced using the ``pylab`` interface to
``matplotlib``.
This is done purposefully for two reasons. The first stems from the fact that currently all students have received
exposure to MATLAB in a prior course, and secondly, I wish to augment, and not replace, the students' MATLAB
knowledge since industry is still lagging when it comes to using open source tools.

Digital Signal Processing
=========================

As a simple starting point this first case study deals with the mathematical representation of signals. A step function
sequence :math:`u[n]` is defined as

.. math::
   :label: step_fctn

   u[n] = \begin{cases} 1, & n \geq 0 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}

Here I consider the difference between two step sequences starting at :math:`n=0` and the other starting at :math:`n=5`.
I thus construct in Python

.. math::
   :label: pulse_sig

   x_3[n] = x_1[n] - x_2[n] = u[n] - u[n-5],

which forms a pulse sequence that *turns on* at :math:`n=0` and *turns off* at :math:`n=5`. A screen capture from
the IPython notebook is shown in Fig. :ref:`fig1`.

.. figure:: scipy_2015_fig1.pdf
   :scale: 55%
   :align: center
   :figclass: htb

   Discrete-time signal generation and manipulation. :label:`fig1`

Of special note in this case study is how the code syntax for the generation of the sequences follows closely the
mathematical form. Note to save space the details of plotting :math:`x_2[n]` and :math:`x_3[n]` are omitted, but the
code that generates and plots :math:`x_3[n]` is simply:

.. code-block:: python

   stem(n,x1 - x2)

Convolution Integral and LTI Systems
====================================

A fundamental signal processing result states that the signal output from a *linear* and *time invariant* (LTI)
system is the *convolution* of the input signal with the system *impulse response*. The impulse response of a
continuous-time LTI system is defined as the system output :math:`h(t)` in response to the input :math:`\delta(t)`,
where :math:`\delta(t)` is the *dirac delta function*. A block diagram of the system model is shown in
Fig. :ref:`fig13`.

.. figure:: scipy_2015_fig13.pdf
   :scale: 80%
   :align: center
   :figclass: htb

   Simple one input one output LTI system block diagram. :label:`fig13`

In mathematical terms the output :math:`y(t)` is the integral

.. math::
   :label: conv_int

   y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(\lambda)x(t-\lambda)\, d\lambda

Students frequently have problems setting up and evaluating the convolution integral, yet it is an important concept
to learn. The waveforms of interest are
typically piecewise continuous, so the integral must be evaluated over one or more contiguous intervals. Consider the
case of :math:`x(t) = u(t) - u(t-T)`, where :math:`u(t)` is the unit step function, and :math:`h(t) = a e^{-at}u(t)`,
where :math:`a > 0`. To avoid careless errors I start with a sketch of the
integrand :math:`h(\lambda)x(t-\lambda)`, as shown in Fig. :ref:`fig12`.
From there I can discover the support intervals or *cases* for evaluating the integral.

.. figure:: scipy_2015_fig12.pdf
   :scale: 60%
   :align: center
   :figclass: htb

   Sketches of :math:`x(t)`, :math:`h(t)`, and :math:`h(\lambda)x(t-\lambda)`. :label:`fig12`

A screen capture of a notebook that details the steps of solving the convolution integral is given in Fig. :ref:`fig10`.
In this same figure we see the analytical solution is easily plotted for the case of :math:`T=1` and :math:`a=5`.

.. figure:: scipy_2015_fig10.pdf
   :scale: 55%
   :align: center
   :figclass: htb

   Solving the convolution integral in the notebook :label:`fig10`.

To bring closure to the tedious analytical solution development, I encourage students check their work using computer
simulation. The function
``ssd.conv_integral()`` performs numerical evaluation of the convolution integral for both finite and semi-infinite extent
limits. I simply need to provide an array of signal/impulse response sample values over the complete
support interval. The screen capture of Fig. :ref:`fig11` shows how this is done in a notebook. Parameter variation is also
explored. Seeing the two approaches provide the same numerical values is rewarding and a powerful testimony to how the IPython notebook improves
learning and understanding.

   :align: center
   :figclass: htb

   Plotting :math:`y(t)` for :math:`a=1, 5`, and :math:`10`. :label:`fig11`


Convolutional Coding for Digital Communications
===============================================

In this case study the coding theory class contained in ``fec_conv.py`` is exercised. Here the
specific case is taken from a final exam using a rate 1/2, :math:`K=5` code. Fig. :ref:`fig2` shows the construction
of a ``fec_conv`` object and a plot of one code symbol of the trellis.

.. figure:: scipy_2015_fig2.pdf
   :scale: 55%
   :align: center
   :figclass: htb

   transmission of one code symbol. :label:`fig2`

   :scale: 55%
   :align: center
   :figclass: hbt

   Passing random bits through the encoder/decoder and plotting an instance of the survivor paths. :label:`fig3`

At the digital communications receiver the received signal is demodulated into *soft decision* channel bits. The soft
values are used to calculate *branch metrics*, which then are used to update cumulative metrics held in each of the 16
states of the trellis. There are two possible paths arriving at each state, but the *surviving* path is the one
producing the minimum cumulative metric.

Fig. :ref:`fig3` shows the survivor traceback paths in the 16-state
trellis while sending random bits through the encoding/decoding process.
Additive noise in the communications channel
introduces confusion in the formation of the traceback paths. The channel *signal-to-noise ratio* (SNR), defined as the
ratio of received signal power to background noise power, sets the operating condition for the system.
In Fig. :ref:`fig3` the
SNR, equivalently denoted by :math:`E_b/N_0`), is set at 7 dB. At a  *decision depth* of 25
code symbols, all 16 paths merge to a common path, making it very likely that the probability of a bit error, is very
very small. At lower a SNR, not shown here, the increased noise level makes it take longer to see a traceback merge
and this is indicative of an increase in the probability of making a bit error.

..
    Pulse Train Power Spectral Density
    ==================================

    Fourier analysis is common place in both communications and signal processing problems. This case study considers the
    power spectral density (PSD) of a continuous-time *pulse train*. Here the notebook is used to calculate and then plot
    the analytical results. The screenshot of Fig. :ref:`fig4` is taken from a notebook used during
    a communications theory course lecture. A brief mathematical model is contained in the notebook followed by a
    numerical example, which includes the PSD plot. The function ``ssd.line_spectra`` plots the theoretical spectrum.
    Simulation results using the fast Fourier transform, not shown here, closely match Fig. :ref:`fig4`.

    .. figure:: scipy_2015_fig4.pdf
       :scale: 55%
       :align: center
       :figclass: htb

       Formulating the power spectrum of a pulse train signal and then plotting the line spectrum for a particular
       parameter set. :label:`fig4`


Real-Time Digital Signal Processing
===================================

In the real-time digital signal processing (DSP) course C-code is written for an embedded processor. In this case the processor
is an ARM Cortex-M4. The objective of this case study is to implement an equal-ripple *finite impulse response* (FIR)
lowpass filter of prescribed amplitude response specifications. The filter is also LTI. Python (``scipy.signal``) is used
to design the filter and obtain
the filter coefficients, :math:`b_1[n],\ n=0,\ldots,M`, in ``float64`` precision. Here the filter order turns out to be
:math:`M=77`. As in the case of continuous-time LTI systems, the relation between the filter input and output
again involves a convolution. Since a digital filter is a discrete-time system, the *convolution sum* now appears. Furthermore,
for the LTI system of interest here, the convolution sum can be replaced by a *difference equation* representation:

.. math::
   :label: LCCDE

   y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{M} x[n] b[n-k],\ -\infty < n < \infty

In real-time DSP (:ref:`LCCDE`) becomes an algorithm running in real-time according to the system sampling rate clock.
The processor is working with ``int16`` precision, so once the filter is designed
the coefficients are scaled and rounded to 16 bit signed integers as shown in Fig. :ref:`fig5`. The fixed-point filter
coefficients are written to a C header file using a custom function defined in the notebook (not shown here).

.. figure:: scipy_2015_fig5.pdf
   :scale: 55%
   :align: center
   :figclass: htb

   Designing an equal-ripple lowpass filter using `scipy.signal.remez` for real-time operation. :label:`fig5`

The filter frequency response magnitude is obtained using a noise source to drive the filter input (first passing
through an analog-to-digital converter) and then the filter output (following digital-to-analog conversion) is processed
by instrumentation to obtain a spectral estimate. Here the output spectrum estimate corresponds to the filter frequency
response.
The measured frequency response is imported into the notebook using ``loadtxt()``. Fig. :ref:`fig6` compares the
theoretical frequency response, including quantization errors, with the measured response.
The results compare favorably. Comparing theory with experiment is something students are frequently asked to do in lab
courses. The fact that the stopband response is not quite equal-ripple is due to coefficient
quantization. This is easy to show right in the notebook by overlaying the frequency response using the original
``float64`` coefficients ``b1``, as obtained in Fig. :ref:`fig5`, with the response obtained using the ``b1_fix``
coefficients as also obtained in Fig. :ref:`fig5` (the plot is not shown here).

   :scale: 55%
   :align: center
   :figclass: htb

   Comparing the theoretical fixed-point frequency response with the measured. :label:`fig6`

An important property of the equal-ripple lowpass is that the filter coefficients, :math:`b[n]`,
have even symmetry. This means that :math:`b_1[M-n] = b_1[n]` for :math:`0\leq n \leq M`. Taking the
:math:`z`-transform of both sides of (:ref:`LCCDE`) using the convolution theorem [Opp2010]_ results in
:math:`Y(z) = H(z)X(z)`, where :math:`Y(z)` is the :math:`z`-transform of :math:`y[n]`, :math:`X(z)`
is the *z*-transform of :math:`x[n]`, and :math:`H(z)`, known as the *system function*, is the *z*-transform of the
system impulse response. The system function :math:`H(z)` takes the form

.. math::
   :label: sys_func

   H(z) = \sum_{n=0}^M b_n z^{-n} \overset{\text{also}}{=}
    \frac{1}{z^M}\prod_{n=1}^M \big(z-z_n\big),

In general :math:`H(z) = N(z)/D(z)` is a rational function of :math:`z` or :math:`z^{-1}`. The roots of :math:`N(z)` are
the system zeros and roots of :math:`D(z)` are the system poles. Students are taught that a *pole-zero*
plot gives much insight into the frequency response of a system, in particular a filter. The module ``ssd.py`` provides
the function ``ssd.zplane(b,a)`` where ``b`` contains the coefficients of :math:`N(z)` and ``a`` contains the
coefficients of :math:`D(z)`; in this case ``a = [1]``. The even symmetry condition constrains the system zeros to
lie at conjugate reciprocal locations [Opp2010]_ as seen in Fig. :ref:`fig7`.


.. figure:: scipy_2015_fig7.pdf
   :scale: 55%
   :align: center
   :figclass: htb

   Pole-zero plot of the equal-ripple lowpass which confirms that :math:`H(z)` is linear phase. :label:`fig7`

With real filter coefficients the zeros must also occur in conjugate pairs, or on the real axis. When the student sees
the pole-zero plot of Fig. :ref:`fig7` whats jumps off the page is all of the zeros on the unit circle for the filter
stopband. Zeros on the unit circle block signals from passing through the filter.
Secondly, you see conjugate reciprocal zeros at angles over the interval :math:`[-\pi/4, \pi/4]` to define the
filter passband, that is where signals pass through the filter.
As a bit of trivia, zeros not on the unit circle or real axis **must** occur as quadruplets, and that is indeed what is
seen in
Fig. :ref:`fig7`. Note also there are 77 poles at :math:`z=0`, which is expected since :math:`M=77`.
The pole-zero plot enhances the understanding to this symmetrical FIR filter.

Statistical Signal Processing
=============================

This case study is taken from a computer simulation project in a statistical signal processing course taken by graduate
students. The problem
involves the theoretical calculation of the probability density function of a random variable (RV) :math:`\mathbf{w}` where

.. math::

   \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{xy}+\mathbf{z}

is a function of the three RVs :math:`\mathbf{x}`, :math:`\mathbf{y}`, and :math:`\mathbf{z}`. Forming a new RV that
is a function of three RV as given here, requires some serious thinking. Having computer simulation tools available to
check your work is a great comfort.

The screenshot of Fig. :ref:`fig8` explains the problem details, including the theoretical results written out as the
piecewise function ``pdf_proj1_w(w)``.

Setting up the integrals is tedious and students are timid about pushing forward with the calculus. To build
confidence a simulation is constructed and the results are compared with theory in Fig. :ref:`fig9`.

Conclusions and Future Work
---------------------------

Communications and signal processing, as a discipline that sits inside electrical computer engineering, is built on
a strong mathematical modeling foundation. Undergraduate engineering students, despite having taken many mathematics
courses, are often intimidated by the math they find in communications and signals processing course work.
I cannot make the math go away, but good modeling tools make learning and problem solving fun and exciting.
I have found, and hopefully this paper shows, that IPython notebooks are valuable mathematical modeling tools.
The case studies show that IPython notebook offers a means for students of all
levels to explore and gain understanding of difficult engineering concepts.

The use of open-source software is increasing and cannot be overlooked in higher education. Python is readily
accessible by anyone. It is easy to share libraries and notebooks to foster improved communication between students
and faculty members; between researchers, engineers, and collaborators.
IPython and the IPython notebook stand out in large part due to the enthusiasm of the scientific Python developer
community.

What lies ahead is exciting. What comes to mind immediately is getting other faculty on-board. I am optimistic and
look forward to this challenge as tutorial sessions are planned over summer 2015. Other future work avenues
I see are working on more code modules as well as enhancements to the existing modules.
In particular in the convolutional coding class both the encoder and
especially the Viterbi decoder, are numerically intensive. Speed enhancements, perhaps using
*Cython*, are on the list of things to do. Within the notebook I am anxious to experiment with notebook controls/widgets
so as to provide dynamic interactivity to classroom demos.
