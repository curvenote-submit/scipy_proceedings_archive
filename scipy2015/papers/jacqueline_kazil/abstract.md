  science, biology, and other fields, which involves simulating the behavior and
  interaction of many autonomous entities, or agents, over time.
abstract: Agent-based modeling is a computational methodology used in social
  science, biology, and other fields, which involves simulating the behavior and
  interaction of many autonomous entities, or agents, over time. There is
  currently a hole in this area in Python’s robust and growing scientific
  ecosystem. Mesa is a new open-source, Apache 2.0 licensed package meant to
  fill that gap. It allows users to quickly create agent-based models using
  built-in core components (such as agent schedulers and spatial grids) or
  customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based interface;
  and analyze their results using Python’s data analysis tools. Its goal is to
  be a Python 3-based alternative to other popular frameworks based in other
  languages such as NetLogo, Repast, or MASON. Since the framework is being
  built from scratch it is able to incorporate lessons from other tools. In this
  paper, we present Mesa's core features and demonstrate them with a simple
  example model.
