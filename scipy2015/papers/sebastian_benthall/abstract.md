abstract: We introduce BigBang, a new Python toolkit for analyzing online
  collaborative communities such as those that build open source software.
  Mailing lists serve as critical communications infrastructure for many
  communities, including several of the open source software development
  communities that build scientific Python packages. BigBang provides tools for
  analyzing mailing lists. As a demonstration, in this paper we test a
  generative model of network growth on collaborative communities. We derive
  social networks from archival mailing list history and test the
  Barab√°si-Alpert model against this data. We find the model does not fit the
  data, but that mailing list social networks share statistical regularities.
  This suggests room for a new generative model of network formation in the open
  collaborative setting.
