  title: How the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is using Python
  description: >-
    The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a project to build an 8.4m
    telescope at Cerro Pachon, Chile and survey the entire sky every
    three days starting around 2014.
    The scientific goals of the project range from characterizing the
    population of largish asteroids which are in orbits that could hit the
    Earth to understanding the nature of the dark energy that is causing
    the Universe's expansion to accelerate.
