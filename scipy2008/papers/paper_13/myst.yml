  title: Finite Element Modeling of Contact and Impact Problems Using Python
  description: >-
    This paper discusses an on going project to improve the accuracy of
    automotive crash simulations. An existing Python package for finite element analysis,
    SfePy, is presented along with plans to contribute additional features
    in support of this work, including nonlinear material modeling and
    contact between two bodies.
