title: Finite Element Modeling of Contact and Impact Problems Using Python
abstract: >-
  This paper discusses an on going project to improve the accuracy of
  automotive crash simulations. Two likely causes for discrepancy
  between simulations and the results of real, physical tests are
  discussed. An existing Python package for finite element analysis,
  SfePy, is presented along with plans to contribute additional features
  in support of this work, including nonlinear material modeling and
  contact between two bodies.
