title: 'Mayavi: Making 3D Data Visualization Reusable'
abstract: >-
  Mayavi is a general-purpose 3D scientific visualization package. 
  We believe 3D data visualization is a difficult task and different users can
  benefit from an easy-to-use tool for this purpose. In this article, we
  focus on how Mayavi addresses the needs of different users with a common
  code-base, rather than describing the data visualization functionalities
  of Mayavi, or the visualization model exposed to the user.
