  title: 'Mayavi: Making 3D Data Visualization Reusable'
  description: >-
    Mayavi is a general-purpose 3D scientific visualization package. 
    In this article, we focus on how Mayavi addresses the needs of different users with a common
    code-base, rather than describing the data visualization functionalities
    of Mayavi, or the visualization model exposed to the user.
