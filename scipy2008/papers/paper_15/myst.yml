  title: Summarizing Complexity in High Dimensional Spaces
  description: |
    As the need to analyze high dimensional, multi-spectral data
    on complex physical systems becomes more common, the value of methods that glean useful summary information from the data increases. This paper describes a method that uses information theoretic based complexity estimation measures to provide diagnostic summary information from medical images.
