title: Summarizing Complexity in High Dimensional Spaces
abstract: |
  As the need to analyze high dimensional, multi-spectral data
  on complex physical systems becomes more common, the value of methods that glean useful summary information from the data increases. This paper describes a method that uses information theoretic based complexity estimation measures to provide diagnostic summary information from medical images. Implementation of the method would have been difficult if not impossible for a non expert programmer without access to the powerful array processing capabilities provided by SciPy.
