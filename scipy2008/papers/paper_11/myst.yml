  title: Analysis and Visualization of Multi-Scale Astrophysical Simulations Using Python and NumPy
  description: >-
    The study the origins of cosmic structure requires large-scale computer
    simulations beginning with well-constrained, observationally-determined, initial
    conditions. We use Adaptive Mesh Refinement to
    conduct multi-resolution simulations spanning twelve orders of magnitude in
    spatial dimensions and over twenty orders of magnitude in density.
