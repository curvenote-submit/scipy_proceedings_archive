title: Analysis and Visualization of Multi-Scale Astrophysical Simulations Using Python and NumPy
abstract: >-
  The study the origins of cosmic structure requires large-scale computer
  simulations beginning with well-constrained, observationally-determined, initial
  conditions. We use Adaptive Mesh Refinement to
  conduct multi-resolution simulations spanning twelve orders of magnitude in
  spatial dimensions and over twenty orders of magnitude in density. These
  simulations must be analyzed and visualized in a manner that is fast, accurate,
  and reproducible. I present "yt," a cross-platform analysis toolkit written in
  Python. "yt" consists of a data-management layer for transporting and tracking
  simulation outputs, a plotting layer, a parallel analysis layer for handling
  mesh-based and particle-based data, as well as several interfaces. I
  demonstrate how the origins of cosmic structure -- from the scale of clusters
  of galaxies down to the formation of individual stars -- can be analyzed and
  visualized using a NumPy-based toolkit. Additionally, I discuss efforts to
  port this analysis code to other adaptive mesh refinement data formats,
  enabling direct comparison of data between research groups using different
  methods to simulate the same objects.
