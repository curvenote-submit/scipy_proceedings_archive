title: 'Pysynphot: A Python Re-Implementation of a Legacy App in Astronomy'
abstract: |
  Pysynphot is a package that allows astronomers to model, combine, and
  manipulate the spectra of stars or galaxies in simulated observations. It is being developed to replace a widely used legacy
  application, SYNPHOT. While retaining the data-driven philosophy of the original
  application, Pysynphot's architecture and improved algorithms were
  developed to address some of its known weaknesses. The language
  features available in Python and its libraries, including numpy, often
  enabled clean solutions to what were messy problems in the original
  application, and the interactive graphics
  capabilities of matplotlib/pylab, used with a consistent set of
  exposed object attributes, eliminated the need to write
  special-purpose plotting methods. This paper will discuss these points in some detail, as well as
  providing an overview of the problem domain and the object model.
