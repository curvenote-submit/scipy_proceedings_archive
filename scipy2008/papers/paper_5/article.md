title: The SciPy Documentation Project (Technical Overview)
abstract: |
  This summer saw the first NumPy Documentation Marathon, during 
  which many thousands of lines of documentation 
  were written. In addition, a web framework was developed which allows the community to contribute 
  docstrings in a wiki-like fashion, without needing access to the source repository. The new reference 
  guide, which is based on these contributions, was 
  built using the popular Sphinx tool. While the documentation coverage is now better than ever, there 
  is still a lot of work to be done, and we encourage 
  interested parties to register and contribute further.
  This paper gives a more detailed overview of the events leading to this project, and of the technical goals achieved.
