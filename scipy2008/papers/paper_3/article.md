title: 'Interval Arithmetic: Python Implementation and Applications'
abstract: |
  This paper presents the Python implementation of an interval system in
  the extended real set that is closed under arithmetic operations. This
  system consists of the lattice generated by union and intersection of
  closed intervals, with operations defined by image closure of their
  real set counterparts. The effects of floating-point rounding are
  accounted for in the implementation. Two applications will be
  discussed: (1) estimating the precision of numerical computations, and
  (2) solving non-linear equations (possibly with multiple solutions)
  using an interval Newton-Raphson algorithm.
