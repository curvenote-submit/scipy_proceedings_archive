  title: 'Interval Arithmetic: Python Implementation and Applications'
  description: |
    This paper presents the Python implementation of an interval system in
    the extended real set that is closed under arithmetic operations. This
    system consists of the lattice generated by union and intersection of
    closed intervals, with operations defined by image closure of their
    real set counterparts.
