title: Exploring Network Structure, Dynamics, and Function using NetworkX
abstract: |
  NetworkX is a Python language package for exploration and analysis of
  networks and network algorithms. The core package provides data
  structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs,
  including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel
  edges and self-loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any
  (hashable) Python object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this
  flexibility makes NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in
  many different scientific fields.
  In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are
  implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures:
  shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree
  distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph
  formats for easy exchange with existing data, and provides generators
  for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the
  Erdos-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models.
  The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language
  together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful
  tool for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work
  studying synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how
  NetworkX enables research in the field of computational networks.
