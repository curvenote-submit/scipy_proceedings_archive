title: Converting Python Functions to Dynamically Compiled C
abstract: >-
  Applications written in Python often suffer from the lack of
  speed, compared to C and other languages which can be compiled to native machine code. In this paper we discuss ways to write functions in pure Python and still benefit from the speed provided by C code compiled to machine code. The focus is to make it as easy as possible for the programmer to write these functions.
