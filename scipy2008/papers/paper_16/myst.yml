  title: Converting Python Functions to Dynamically Compiled C
  description: >-
    Applications written in Python often suffer from the lack of
    speed, compared to C and other languages which can be compiled
    to native machine code. In this paper we discuss ways to write
    functions in pure Python and still benefit from the speed provided
    by C code compiled to machine code.
