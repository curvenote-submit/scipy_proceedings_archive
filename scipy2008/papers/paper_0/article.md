title: Editorial
abstract: This year marked the 7th edition of the conference; however, it is the first edition for which proceedings are to be published. We are thrilled by this new development. These proceedings are the sign of a maturing community not only of developers, but also of scientific users. Pythonâ€™s use as a tool for producing scientific results is, by now, well established. Its status as the subject of research and academic publication is now being recognized and we hope that the proceedings of the SciPy Conference will help communicate how scientists and engineers are using and building upon various Python tools to solve their problems.
