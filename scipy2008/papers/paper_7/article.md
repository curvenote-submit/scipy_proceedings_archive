title: The SciPy Documentation Project
abstract: |
  The SciPy Documentation Project seeks to provide NumPy and SciPy with
  professional documentation and documentation access tools in a variety
  of formats. As our first effort, we have sponsored the SciPy Documentation Marathon 2008, whose goal is to produce reference documentation for the most-used portions of NumPy. I present an
  overview of current efforts and future plans.
