  title: Realtime Astronomical Time-series Classification and Broadcast Pipeline
  description: The Transients Classification Pipeline (TCP) is a Berkeley-led, Python based project which federates data streams from multiple surveys and observatories, classifies with machine learning and astronomer defined science priors, and broadcasts sources of interest to various science clients. This multi-node pipeline uses Python wrapped classification algorithms, some of which will be generated by training machine learning software using astronomer classified time-series data.
