title: Matplotlib Solves the Riddle of the Sphinx
abstract: |
  This paper shares our experience converting matplotlib's documentation to use Sphinx and will hopefully encourage
  other projects to do so. Matplotlib's documentation serves as a good
  test case, because it includes both narrative text and API docstrings,
  and makes use of automatically plotted figures and mathematical
  expressions.
