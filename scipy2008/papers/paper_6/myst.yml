  title: Matplotlib Solves the Riddle of the Sphinx
  description: >-
    This paper shares our experience converting matplotlib's documentation to use Sphinx and will hopefully encourage
    other projects to do so. Matplotlib's documentation serves as a good
    test case, because it includes both narrative text and API docstrings,
    and makes use of automatically plotted figures and mathematical
    expressions.
