title: 'Circuitscape: A Tool for Landscape Ecology'
abstract: |
  The modeling of ecological connectivity across networks and landscapes
  is an active research area that spans the disciplines of ecology,
  conservation, and population genetics. Recently, concepts and
  algorithms from electrical circuit theory have been adapted to address
  these problems. The approach is based on linkages between circuit and
  random walk theories, and has several advantages over previous
  analytic approaches, including incorporation of multiple dispersal
  pathways into analyses. Here we describe Circuitscape, a
  computational tool developed for modeling landscape connectivity using
  circuit theory. Our Python implementation can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes,
  or landscapes with millions of raster cells.
