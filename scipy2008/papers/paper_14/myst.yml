  title: 'Circuitscape: A Tool for Landscape Ecology'
  description: >-
    The modeling of ecological connectivity across networks and landscapes
    is an active research area that spans the disciplines of ecology,
    conservation, and population genetics. Here we describe Circuitscape, a
    computational tool developed for modeling landscape connectivity using
    circuit theory.
