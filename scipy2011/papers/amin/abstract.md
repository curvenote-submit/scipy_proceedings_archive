title: A Technical Anatomy of SPM.Python, a Scalable, Parallel Version of Python
description: SPM.Python is a scalable, parallel fault-tolerant version of the
  serial Python language, and can be deployed to create parallel capabilities to
  solve problems in domains spanning finance, life sciences, electronic design,
  IT, visualization, and research.
abstract: SPM.Python is a scalable, parallel fault-tolerant version of the
  serial Python language, and can be deployed to create parallel capabilities to
  solve problems in domains spanning finance, life sciences, electronic design,
  IT, visualization, and research. Software developers may use SPM.Python to
  augment new or existing (Python) serial scripts for scalability across
  parallel hardware. Alternatively, SPM.Python may be used to better manage the
  execution of stand-alone (non-Python x86 and GPU) applications across compute
  resources in a fault-tolerant manner taking into account hard deadlines.
