description: In recent years, one of the fastest growing trends in information
  technology has been the move towards cloud computing. The scalable concept of
  computing resources on demand allows applications to dynamically react to
  increased usage instead of having to keep resources in reserve that are often
  not in use but are still paid for.
abstract: In recent years, one of the fastest growing trends in information
  technology has been the move towards cloud computing. The scalable concept of
  computing resources on demand allows applications to dynamically react to
  increased usage instead of having to keep resources in reserve that are often
  not in use but are still paid for. There are several popular entrants into
  this market including Google App Engine. Modeled after Google's own
  architecture for building applications, Google App Engine (GAE) provides a
  scalable solution for web-based applications and services including data
  storage, communications, application deployment and monitoring, and management
  tools. With GAE, developers have the option of writing applications using an
  API exposed to Python. The same benefits of using Python in other applications
  are available in the cloud.
