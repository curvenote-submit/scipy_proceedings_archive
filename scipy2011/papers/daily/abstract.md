title: Using the Global Arrays Toolkit to Reimplement NumPy for Distributed
  Computation
description: Global Arrays (GA) is a software system from Pacific Northwest
  National Laboratory that enables an efficient, portable, and parallel
  shared-memory programming interface to manipulate distributed dense arrays.
abstract: Global Arrays (GA) is a software system from Pacific Northwest
  National Laboratory that enables an efficient, portable, and parallel
  shared-memory programming interface to manipulate distributed dense arrays.
  Using a combination of GA and NumPy, we have reimplemented NumPy as a
  distributed drop-in replacement called Global Arrays in NumPy (GAiN).
  Scalability studies will be presented showing the utility of developing serial
  NumPy codes which can later run on more capable clusters or supercomputers.
