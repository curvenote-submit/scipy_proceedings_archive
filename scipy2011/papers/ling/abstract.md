title: IMUSim - Simulating inertial and magnetic sensor systems in Python
description: IMUSim is a new simulation package developed in Python to model
  Inertial Measurement Units, i.e. devices which include accelerometers,
  gyroscopes and magnetometers. It was developed in the course of our research
  into algorithms for IMU-based motion capture, and has now been released under
  the GPL for the benefit of other researchers and users.
abstract: IMUSim is a new simulation package developed in Python to model
  Inertial Measurement Units, i.e. devices which include accelerometers,
  gyroscopes and magnetometers. It was developed in the course of our research
  into algorithms for IMU-based motion capture, and has now been released under
  the GPL for the benefit of other researchers and users. The software generates
  realistic sensor readings based on trajectory, environment, sensor and system
  models. It includes implementaions of various relevant processing algorithms
  and mathematical utilities, some of which may be useful elsewhere. The
  simulator makes extensive use of NumPy, SciPy, SimPy, Cython, Matplotlib and
  Mayavi. The rapid development enabled by these tools allowed the project to be
  completed as a side project by two researchers. Careful design of an
  object-oriented API for the various models involved in the simulation allows
  the software to remain flexible and extensible while requiring users to write
  a minimum amount of code to use it.
