title: "Crab: A Recommendation Engine Framework for Python"
description: Crab is a flexible, fast recommender engine for Python that
  integrates classic information filtering recommendation algorithms in the
  world of scientific Python packages (NumPy,SciPy, Matplotlib). The engine aims
  to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized
  recommender system from a set of algorithms.
abstract: "Crab is a flexible, fast recommender engine for Python that
  integrates classic information filtering recommendation algorithms in the
  world of scientific Python packages (NumPy,SciPy, Matplotlib). The engine aims
  to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized
  recommender system from a set of algorithms. It is designed for scability,
  flexibility and performance making use of scientific optimized python packages
  in order to provide simple and efficient solutions that are acessible to
  everybody and reusable in various contexts: science and engineering. The
  engine takes users' preferences for items and returns estimated preferences
  for other items. For instance, a web site that sells movies could easily use
  Crab to figure out, from past purchase data, which movies a customer might be
  interested in watching to. This work presents our inniative in developing this
  framework in Python following the standards of the well-known machine learning
  toolkit Scikit-Learn to be an alternative solution for Mahout Taste
  collaborative framework for Java. Finally, we discuss its main features, real
  scenarios where this framework is already applied and future extensions."
