abstract: Obtaining time-series monitoring data in a particular region often
  requires a significant effort involving visiting multiple websites, contacting
  multiple organizations and dealing with a variety of data formats. Although
  there has been a large research effort nationally in techniques to share and
  disseminate water related time-series monitoring data, development of a usable
  system has lagged. The pieces have been available for some time now, but a
  lack of vision,expertise, resources and software licensing requirements have
  hindered uptake outside of the academic research groups. The Texas Water
  Development Board is both a data provider and large user of data collected by
  other entities. As such, using the lessons learned from the last several years
  of research, we have implemented an expandable infrastructure for sharing
  water data in Texas. In this paper, we discuss the social, institutional and
  technological challenges in creating a system that allows discovery, access,
  and publication of water data from multiple federal, state, local and
  university sources and how we have used Python to create this system in a
  resource limited environment.
