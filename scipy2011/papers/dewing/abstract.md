title: Constructing scientific programs using SymPy
description: We describe a method for constructing scientific programs where
  SymPy is used to model the mathematical steps in the derivation. With this
  workflow, each step in the process can be checked by machine, from the
  derivation of the equations to the generation of the source code.
abstract: We describe a method for constructing scientific programs where SymPy
  is used to model the mathematical steps in the derivation. With this workflow,
  each step in the process can be checked by machine, from the derivation of the
  equations to the generation of the source code. We present an example based on
  computing the partition function integrals in statistical mechanics.
