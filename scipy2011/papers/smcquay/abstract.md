abstract: The research contained herein yielded an open source interpolation
  library implemented in and designed for use with the Python programming
  language. This library, named smbinterp, yields an interpolation to an
  arbitrary degree of accuracy. The smbinterp module was designed to be mesh
  agnostic. A plugin system was implemented that allows end users to
  conveniently and consistently present their numerical results to the library
  for rapid prototyping and integration. The library includes modules that allow
  for its use in high-performance parallel computing environments. These modules
  were implemented using built-in Python modules to simplify deployment. This
  implementation was found to scale linearly to approximately 180 participating
  compute processes.
