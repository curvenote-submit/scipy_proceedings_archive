title: 'gpustats: GPU Library for Statistical Computing in Python'
description: In this work we discuss gpustats, a new Python library for
  assisting in "big data" statistical computing
  applications, particularly Monte Carlo-based inference algorithms. The library
  provides a general code generation / metaprogramming framework for easily
  implementing discrete and continuous probability density functions and random
  variable samplers.
abstract: In this work we discuss gpustats, a new Python library for assisting
  in "big data" statistical computing applications,
  particularly Monte Carlo-based inference algorithms. The library provides a
  general code generation / metaprogramming framework for easily implementing
  discrete and continuous probability density functions and random variable
  samplers. These functions can be utilized to achieve more than 100x speedup
  over their CPU equivalents. We demonstrate their use in an Bayesian MCMC
  application and discuss avenues for future work.
