title: A Computational Framework for Plasmonic Nanobiosensing
description: Basic principles in biosensing and nanomaterials precede the
  introduction of a novel fiber optic sensor. Software limitations in the
  biosensing domain are presented, followed by the development of a Python-based
  simulation environment.

  introduction of a novel fiber optic sensor. Software limitations in the
  biosensing domain are presented, followed by the development of a Python-based
  simulation environment. Finally, the current state of spectral data analysis
  within the Python ecosystem is discussed.
