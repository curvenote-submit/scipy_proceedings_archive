title: The Reference Model for Disease Progression
description: The Reference Model for disease progression is based on a modeling
  framework written in Python. It is a prototype that demonstrates the use of
  computing power to aid in chronic disease forecast. The model uses references
  to publicly available data as a source of information, hence the name for the
  model.
abstract: The Reference Model for disease progression is based on a modeling
  framework written in Python. It is a prototype that demonstrates the use of
  computing power to aid in chronic disease forecast. The model uses references
  to publicly available data as a source of information, hence the name for the
  model. The Reference Model also holds this name since it is designed to be
  used by other models as a reference. The model uses parallel processing and
  computing power to create a competition among hypothesis of disease
  progression. The system runs on a multi core machine and is scalable to a
  SLURM cluster.
