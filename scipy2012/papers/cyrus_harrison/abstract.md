abstract: VisIt is an open source, turnkey application for scientific data
  analysis and visualization that runs on a wide variety of platforms from
  desktops to petascale class supercomputers. VisIt's core software
  infrastructure is written in C++, however Python plays a vital role in
  enabling custom workflows. Recent work has extended Python's use in VisIt
  beyond scripting, enabling custom Python UIs and Python filters for low-level
  data manipulation. The ultimate goal of this work is to evolve Python into a
  true peer to our core C++ plugin infrastructure. This paper provides an
  overview of Pythonâ€™s role in VisIt with a focus on use cases of scripted
  rendering, data analysis, and custom application development.
