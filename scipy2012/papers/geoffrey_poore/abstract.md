  PythonTeX is a new LaTeX package that provides access to the full power of
  Python from within LaTeX documents. It allows Python code entered within a
  LaTeX document to be executed, and provides access to the output. PythonTeX
  also provides syntax highlighting for any language supported by the Pygments
  highlighting engine.


  PythonTeX is fast and user-friendly. Python code is separated into
  user-defined sessions. Each session is only executed when its code is
  modified. When code is executed, sessions run in parallel. The contents of
  stdout and stderr are synchronized with the LaTeX document, so that printed
  content is easily accessible and error messages have meaningful line
  numbering.


  PythonTeX simplifies scientific document creation with LaTeX. Plots can be
  created with matplotlib and then customized in place. Calculations can be
  performed and automatically typeset with NumPy. SymPy can be used to
  automatically create mathematical tables and step-by-step mathematical
  derivations.
