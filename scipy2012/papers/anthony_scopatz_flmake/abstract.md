abstract: "FLASH is a high-performance computing (HPC) multi-physics code which
  is used to perform astrophysical and high-energy density physics simulations.
  To run a FLASH simulation, the user must go through three basic steps: setup,
  build, and execution. Canonically, each of these tasks are independently
  handled by the user. However, with the recent advent of flmake - a Python
  workflow management utility for FLASH - such tasks may now be performed in a
  fully reproducible way. To achieve such reproducibility a number of
  developments and abstractions were needed, some only enabled by Python. These
  methods are widely applicable outside of FLASH. The process of writing flmake
  opens many questions to what precisely is meant by reproducibility in
  computational science. While posed here, many of these questions remain
  unanswered."
