title: Fcm - A python library for flow cytometry
description: Flow cytometry has the ability to measure multiple parameters of a
  heterogeneous mix of cells at single cell resolution. This has lead flow
  cytometry to become an integral tool in immunology and biology.
abstract: Flow cytometry has the ability to measure multiple parameters of a
  heterogeneous mix of cells at single cell resolution. This has lead flow
  cytometry to become an integral tool in immunology and biology. Most flow
  cytometry analysis is performed in expensive proprietary software packages,
  and few opensource tool exist for working with flow cytometry data. In this
  paper we present fcm, an BSD licensed python library for traditional gating
  based analysis in addition to newer model based analysis methods.
