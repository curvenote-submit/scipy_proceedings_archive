title: A Tale of Four Libraries
description: This work describes the use some scientific Python tools to solve
  information gathering problems using Reinforcement Learning. In particular, we
  focus on the problem of designing an agent able to learn how to gather
  information in linked datasets.
abstract: This work describes the use some scientific Python tools to solve
  information gathering problems using Reinforcement Learning. In particular, we
  focus on the problem of designing an agent able to learn how to gather
  information in linked datasets. We use four different libraries—RL-Glue,
  Gensim, NetworkX, and scikit-learn—during different stages of our research. We
  show that, by using NumPy arrays as the default vector/matrix format, it is
  possible to integrate these libraries with minimal effort.
