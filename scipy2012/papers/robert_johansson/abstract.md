title: "QuTiP: A framework for the dynamics of open quantum systems using SciPy
  and Cython"
description: We present QuTiP (http://www.qutip.org), an object-oriented,
  open-source framework for solving the dynamics of open quantum systems.
  Written in Python, and using a combination of Cython, NumPy, SciPy, and
  matplotlib, QuTiP provides an environment for computational quantum mechanics
  that is both easy and efficient to use.
abstract: We present QuTiP (http://www.qutip.org), an object-oriented,
  open-source framework for solving the dynamics of open quantum systems.
  Written in Python, and using a combination of Cython, NumPy, SciPy, and
  matplotlib, QuTiP provides an environment for computational quantum mechanics
  that is both easy and efficient to use. Arbitrary quantum systems, including
  time-dependent systems, may be built up from operators and states defined by a
  quantum object class, and then passed on to a choice of unitary or dissipative
  evolution solvers. Here we give an overview of the basic structure for the
  framework, and the techniques used in its implementation. We also present a
  few selected examples from current research on quantum mechanics that
  illustrate the strengths of the framework, as well as the types of
  calculations that can be performed. This framework is particularly well suited
  to the fields of quantum optics, superconducting circuit devices,
  nanomechanics, and trapped ions, while also being ideal as an educational
  tool.
