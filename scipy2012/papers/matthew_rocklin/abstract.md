title: Uncertainty Modeling with SymPy Stats
description: We add a random variable type to a mathematical modeling language.
  We demonstrate through examples how this is a highly separable way to
  introduce uncertainty and produce and query stochastic models. We motivate the
  use of symbolics and thin compilers in scientific computing.
