abstract: In this paper, I describe the workings of my personal hobby project -
  a self-driving lego mindstorms robot. The body of the robot is built with Lego
  Mindstorms. An Android smartphone is used to capture the view in front of the
  robot. A user first teaches the robot how to drive; this is done by making the
  robot go around a track a small number of times. The image data, along with
  the user action is used to train a Neural Network. At run-time, images of what
  is in front of the robot are fed into the neural network and the appropriate
  driving action is selected. This project showcases the power of python's
  libraries, as they enabled me to put together a sophisticated working system
  in a very short amount of time. Specifically, I made use of the Python Image
  Library to downsample images, as well as the PyBrain neural network library.
  The robot was controlled using the nxt-python library.
